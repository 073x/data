Since face recognition is the main goal of this tutorial we will form teams of 2-3 people and recognize the faces in a live feed. We will make use of the OpenCV computer vision and machine learning library. OpenCV includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms",
