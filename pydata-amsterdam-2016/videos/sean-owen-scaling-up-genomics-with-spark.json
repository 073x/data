  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2016\n\nDescription\n\nThis talk will briefly introduce the problem of genomics and existing home-grown efforts to bring \"big data\" technology to solve genomics\n\nAbstract\n\nIt's amazing that our genome so completely and uniquely encodes each of us with a simple 4-protein code, like a file. More amazingly, we're so similar that we can build a reference map of human genomes and reason about commonalities. Genomics has taken off in the last two decades driven largely by advances in computing; the work of mapping the genome is incredibly data and compute intensive. This talk will briefly introduce the problem of genomics and existing home-grown efforts to bring \"big data\" technology to solve it. It will compare these with the separate rise of technologies like Apache Hadoop and Spark, and how these ideas are helping genomics scale up even further.",
