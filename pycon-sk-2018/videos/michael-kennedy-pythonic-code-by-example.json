  "description": "We often hear the term Pythonic thrown around, but what exactly does it mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its users.\n\nPycon SK 2018\nKiwi.com Hall (-1.61)\nSaturday 10. March: 12:55",
