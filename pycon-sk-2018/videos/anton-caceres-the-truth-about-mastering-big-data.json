  "description": "What do you think is the most essential skill a data scientist should master? Knowledge of deep learning tools? Hadoop? SciPy?\n\nThis talk reveals the cornerstone of data science: nothing is as important as asking data the right questions. To make it work, we need some tools and curiosity.\n\nWhile focusing on tools, we will first go over the data science subject as a whole, define our goals, continue with an overview of the essential Python packages like Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, and conclude with a live demo. The purpose of this talk is to understand our data: read it, visualize, and formulate right questions, as well as to endorse your imagination as a data scientist.",
