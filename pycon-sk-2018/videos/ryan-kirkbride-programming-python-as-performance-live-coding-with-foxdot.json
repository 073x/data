  "description": "In this talk I will introduce the topic of live coding; the interactive programming experience for generating audio and visuals but this talk will mainly focus on audio. Live coders use programming languages to describe rules for generating music but then re-write these rules while the program is running. By continually writing and re-writing these rules live coders creating a shifting musical experience that is always in flux. All of this happens live in front of audience with the code projected for all to see. I will go on to discuss the multiple tools that are available for live coding and showcase the FoxDot environment, which allows you to live code music using Python. I will talk about the motivation for developing FoxDot and describe some of its key features as well as how you can set it up yourself at home. The talk will be concluded with a short demonstration that will be part explanation and part performance.",
