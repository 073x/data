  "description": "Internet service providers, ad networks, governments\u2026 Many organizations have increasing access to our personal information. Protecting privacy in this environment is a non-trivial effort, and the threats posed by malicious attackers further exacerbates this problem. We, as developers, owe it to ourselves and to our communities to do the best we can to improve our collective security and privacy.\n\nAttendees of this talk will walk away with a thorough understanding of the following topics and the problems they solve:\n\n* multi-factor authentication\n* encrypted DNS\n* SSH/VPN tunnels\n* full disk encryption\n* compartment isolation\n* \u201conion-skin\u201d routing\n\nIn addition, digital interactions with other people increasingly occur via hosted services, which while convenient can compromise the privacy, integrity, and control of our data. With some open-source software and inexpensive virtual servers, we can take back control and empower us all to securely share our lives with one another.",
