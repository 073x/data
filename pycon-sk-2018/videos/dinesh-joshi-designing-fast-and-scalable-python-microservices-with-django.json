  "description": "Django, combined with the Django REST framework, makes it very easy to build RESTful MicroServices. However, Django is perceived to have some overhead making it hard to build fast and scalable MicroServices. This talk shows you how to squeeze the last bit of performance from django. We will focus on Django\u2019s key architectural components and the right way to use them. Using profiling, we will identify bottlenecks and fix them enabling you to build scalable RESTful services that play to Django's strengths. At the end of the talk you will have a good handle on building scalable MicroServices with Django.",
