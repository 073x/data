  "description": "My brain is different. The regions involved in concentration, impulse control, and inhibition are smaller than usual; Like somewhere between 5% and 12% of adults I have ADHD. Even if you do not have the disorder yourself you probably work, live or know someone who does. But the world is not designed for people with ADHD, so to be successful I\u2019ve had to develop techniques to keep my concentration and procrastination in check.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not only concentration but also executive function. Then we\u2019ll explore how changes in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but anyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus. Next, we\u2019ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what you can do personally to increase your concentration and output without burning out. Then I\u2019ll present some techniques you can rollout within your team to remove distractions while improving the quality of communication.",
