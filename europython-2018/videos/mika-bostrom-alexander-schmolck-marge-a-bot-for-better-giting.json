  "description": "Over the past decade, development workflows across industries have\nconverged towards Continuous Integration (CI) with pull requests (PR).\nAutomated testing and artifact generation is useful, but the logic is\noften flawed: test are run against the source branch, and side effects\nfrom successful merges are not accounted for. Marge-bot improves this\nworkflow by allowing to test the PR against the target branch while\nproviding a host of other conveniences.\n",
