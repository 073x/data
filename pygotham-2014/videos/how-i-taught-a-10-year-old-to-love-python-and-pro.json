  "description": "After many trails and tribulations, a few months ago I finally got my\n10-year-old brother hooked on programming with Python. I posted a brief\nsnippet on reddit's /r/learnpython about it and the post went over very\nwell, with many people asking me for more in-depth instructions of and a\nsort of curriculum they could use. I have created that material and\nwould like to expand upon it with this talk.\n",
