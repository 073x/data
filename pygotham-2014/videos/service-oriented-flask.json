  "description": "Building service oriented web apps is a great way to separate concerns,\nparallelize development, and scale high traffic apps. One of the\ndownsides of service oriented web applications, however, is managing the\nhigh overhead of communication between services, and handling the\nadditional complexities that come along with service driven development.\n\nIn this presentation, Randall Degges, Stormpath Developer Evangelist and\nOpenCNAM co-founder, will share all of the best practices he learned\nwhile building OpenCNAM, supporting billions of API requests.\n",
