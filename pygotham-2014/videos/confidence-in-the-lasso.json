  "description": "The lasso is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms\nfrom the past 15 years. Conceived by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman\nfrom Stanford, the lasso performs dimension reduction and variable\nselection making it well suited for the high dimensionality of today's\ndatasets. In this talk we will go over some of the math behind the lasso\nand discuss some recent advancements in performing inference on\nlasso-fitted models.\n",
