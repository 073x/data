  "description": "This talk will be an introductory discussion of why Python is an awesome\nprogramming language for analyzing, and playing with, natural language.\n(It\u2019s not the only one, but especially for people just diving in to\nusing a programming language for language play or research, it\u2019s great.)\nRather than going into details of algorithms, I'm going to give some\nsimple, easy-to-build-upon examples of how Python and open source Python\npackages can be used to quickly dive into some really awesome aspects of\nresearch/investigation in linguistics, and bring them together to\nexplain, at a high level, why I believe Python is an excellent bridge\nbetween linguists interested in programming, beginning programmers\ninterested in linguistics, and any curious people who like figuring\nstuff out about languages all along a spectrum of formality.\n",
