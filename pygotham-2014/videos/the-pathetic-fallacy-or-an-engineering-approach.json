  "description": "Software programming is a young discipline, placed somewhere between the\nrigorous world of mathematics and the pragmatic world of engineering. As\nevidence of its immaturity as a discipline, consider how frequently the\nsame problems arise in the practice of writing a programme, and how\nthese problems are unaccompanied by widely-disseminated\nconceptualisations or a commonly agreed-upon pathology or even a\nwell-defined guiding philosophy and epistemology. In other words, we\nkeep running into the same problems, and we often lack even a basis for\ndiscussing them (much less avoiding them)!\n",
