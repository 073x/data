  "description": "If you're new to Python, you might find that you're using Python as if\nit were C. This talk will demonstrate how to take advantage of Python's\nspecial data structures to build tools for analyzing and creating\nnicely-formatted reports from CSV data. (\"CSV\" stands for \"Comma\nSeparated Values\" although the term describes flat files where the\nfields in each row are delimited by commas, or tabs, or pipe characters,\nor whatever. )\n",
