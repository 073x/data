If you follow its best practices and have good \u2018commit hygiene\u2019 it can also be a source of valuable data about your coding practices. In this talk I\u2019ll describe a system we built at Civis that uses the metadata git collects, along with its logging and \u2018blaming\u2019 functionality to score commits in real time on their likelihood of introducing a bug.",
