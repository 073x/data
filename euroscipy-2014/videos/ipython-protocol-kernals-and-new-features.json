  "description": "A key idea behind IPython is decoupling code execution from user\ninterfaces. IPython relies on a documented protocol, which can be\nimplemented by different frontends and different kernels. By\nimplementing it, frontends and kernels gain the ability to communicate\nregardless of which language they're written in. The IPython project\nmaintains three different frontends, while there are multiple third\nparty frontends and kernels already in use.\n\nWe will show some important features that such a protocol permits, by\ndemonstrating some of our alternative frontends, as well as kernels that\npeople have written in languages such as Julia and R. Our presentation\nwill also feature interactive widgets, a new feature in IPython 2.0, and\npreview the upcoming features that will allow a single notebook server\nto start different types of kernel.\n\nThis will demonstrate that the IPython Notebook is the perfect polyglot\ntool for scientific computation workflows.\n",
