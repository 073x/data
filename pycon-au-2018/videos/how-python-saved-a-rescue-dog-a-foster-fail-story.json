We built a drug delivery system using IoT boards, Python and cloud VMs. This talk tells the story how Python turned a crazy idea into a lifesaving DIY project and a foster fail.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU \u2039https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\u203a.\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (\u201cPyCon AU\u201d) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU",
