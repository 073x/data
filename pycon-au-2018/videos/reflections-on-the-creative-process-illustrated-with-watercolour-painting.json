But we don\u2019t really learn about creativity, usually it's all exception handling and Big O complexity. This talk is about introspection and calm coding in the face of long stack traces. Also, I'll be doing a live watercolour painting at the same time.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\n\nPyCon Australia (\u201cPyCon AU\u201d) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU",
