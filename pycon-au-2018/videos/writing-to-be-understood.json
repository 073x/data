We write commit messages; we\r\nreview our colleagues\u2019 code; we email collaborators; we tweet our hottest\r\ntakes. \r\n\r\nGood written communication can make your systems easier to use and maintain,\r\nencourage your colleagues to be more receptive to your suggestions, and make\r\nyou more popular on the internet. I\u2019ll share some practical ways to communicate\r\nmore effectively, and some less practical theory about how people and language\r\nwork.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU \u2039https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\u203a.\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (\u201cPyCon AU\u201d) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU",
