  "description": "Carles Bruguera - MAX: Realtime messaging and activity stream engine\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nWhat if I told you that we\u2019ve built an open source \u201cWhatsApp\u201d-like\nRESTful API on the top of Pyramid? We've developed MAX: a real-time\nmessaging service and activity stream that has become the key feature\nfor a social intranet at the BarcelonaTech University\n\nWe will show how we designed and built MAX with performance in mind\nusing state of the art Python technologies like Gevent, WSGI, and\nmulti-threaded queue processing. We will also show you how we've\nmanaged to design a simple architecture guaranteeing both high\nscalability and performance, achieving connecting ratios over 30.000\nstudents, teachers, and university staff.\n\nThe API is secured using oAuth 2.0 resource owner password credentials\nflow powered by our own oAuth server implementation (Osiris) also\nPyramid-based. We are using MongoDB as general storage backend and\nRabbitMQ over websockets to support realtime and messaging.",
