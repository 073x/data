  "description": "Jose Ortega - Python Security & Cryptography\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThe talk would aim to introduce cryptography and security from the\ndeveloper point of view, showing ways to encrypt information with\nPython scripts and more sensitive information in web applications\nusing django.\n\nI will introduce to security in python ,showing some libraries that\nallow encryption and decryption like PyCrypto or M2Crypto,comparing\ntheses libraries with the cryptography module.At the same time,I will\nshow the main ciphers and hashing  algorithms used in these libraries\nlike AES,DES,RSA and some examples illustrating each case.I wil show\nother techniques like steganography for hiding information in\nfiles(images,documents,programs) with some libraries like Stepic or\nezPyCrypto.\n\nFinally,I will comment OWASP Python Security Project where we can find\nsome useful practices\nand secure coding guidelines for detecting  potential security\nvulnerabilities  in our applications like SQL injection or Cross-site\nscripting.\n\n**Slides**\n\n[https://speakerdeck.com/jmortega/python-cryptography-and-security][1]\n\n[1]: https://speakerdeck.com/jmortega/python-cryptography-and-security",
