  "description": "Christian Trebing - Building a multi-purpose platform for bulk data using sqlalchemy\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nAt Blue Yonder, we've built a platform that can accept and process\nbulk amounts of data for multiple business domains (e.g. handling\nretail store location and sales data) using SQLAlchemy as a database\nabstraction layer.\n\nWe wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly\nfound that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for\nhandling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not\nwant each team of developers working on individual business domains to\nhave to handcraft their own SQL statements. To solve this problem, we\nbuilt an application configuration that closely resembles an\nSQLAlchemy model, but also contains application-specific logic\nsettings.\n\nIn this talk I will demonstrate:\n\n- An application architecture for multiple business domains\n- The structure of the domain configuration utilized in the generation of the SQLAlchemy model, SQLAlchemy core statements, and other application functionality\n- How the domain configuration is used throughout the application (consuming and parsing incoming data, storing it in a database and ensuring data quality)",
