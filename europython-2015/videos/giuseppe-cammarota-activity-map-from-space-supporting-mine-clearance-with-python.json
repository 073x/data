  "description": "Giuseppe Cammarota - Activity Map from space: supporting mine clearance with Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nRemoving UneXploded Ordnance (UXO) from minefields at the end of a\nconflict is a very time-consuming and expensive operation. Advanced\nsatellite image processing can detect changes and activities on the\nground and represent them on a map that can be used by operators to\nclassify more dangerous zones and safer areas, potentially reducing\nthe time spent on field surveys.\n\nWe exploit space-borne radar Earth images together with thematic data\nfor mapping activities on the ground using numpy, scipy and gdal. The\nActivity Map generation process to be shown will be implemented using\nIPython Notebook.",
