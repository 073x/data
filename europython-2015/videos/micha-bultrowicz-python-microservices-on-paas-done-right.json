I want to change that by showing:\n\n- how thinking in PaaS terms can lead to robust and scalable designs;\n\n- what infrastructure and automation you need to set up to go along smoothly;\n\n- how to get real time metrics of your apps;\n\n- what makes Python good for microservices;\n\n- what is Python's performance relative to some alternatives.\n\n**Prerequisites for the talk:**\n\n- some experience with web development in Python;\n\n- basic knowledge of RESTful web services.",
