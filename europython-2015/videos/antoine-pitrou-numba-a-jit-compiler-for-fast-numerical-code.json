  "description": "Antoine Pitrou - Numba, a JIT compiler for fast numerical code\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThis talk will be a general introduction to Numba. Numba is an open\nsource just\u00ad-in-\u00adtime Python compiler that allows you to speed up\nnumerical algorithms for which fast linear algebra (i.e. Numpy array\noperations) is not enough. It has backends for the CPU and for NVidia\nGPUs. After the talk, the audience should be able to understand for\nwhich use cases Numba is adequate, what level of performance to\nexpect, and have a general notion of its inner working.\n\nA bit of familiarity with scientific computing and/or Numpy is\nrecommended for optimal understanding, but the talk should otherwise\nbe accessible to the average Python programmer. It should also be of\ninterest to people who are curious about attempts at high-\u00adperformance\nPython.\n\n[View slides online][1]\n\n[1]: http://pitrou.net/ep2015/_build/slides/#1",
