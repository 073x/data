  "description": "Lynn Root - Metrics-driven development\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nAt Spotify, my team struggled to be awesome.  We had a very loose\nunderstanding of what product/service our squad was responsible for,\nand even less so of the expectations our internal and external\ncustomers had for those services.  Other than \u201cdoes our Facebook login\nwork?\u201d, we had no understanding of how our services we\u2019re responsible\nfor were doing.  How many users actually sign up or log in with\nFacebook? How many users have connected their Spotify account with\ntheir Uber account?  Do folks even use Spotify with Uber?\n\nWith a 2-month challenge period, my squad and I focused inward to\nestablish those unanswered questions and to establish feedback loops\nand always-on dashboards.  This talk will tell the story of how we\nchose which metrics are important for us to focus on, what\ntechnologies we have used and are using, and how we\u2019ve iterated over\nour feedback loops to fine-tune what metrics we care about.",
