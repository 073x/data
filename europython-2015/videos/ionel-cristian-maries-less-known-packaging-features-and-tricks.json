Everything works almost\nfine, however, lots of new features and tools have been developed\nrecently. Some are really obscure. And there's a chance they can save\nyou time and help you avoid *packaging-induced-pain*. I'm willing to\nbet couple of beers you haven't seen these features and/or tools\nbefore.\n\nThis talk is going to show you:\n\n- Patterns and tricks you can use in your `setup.py`.\n- Obscure pip/setuptools/virtualenv/python features you can use to improve your packaging experience (be it as a user of packages or a package author).\n- Fledgeling alternative tools.\n\n`Slides (HTML with notes) <http://blog.ionelmc.ro/presentations/packaging/>`_",
