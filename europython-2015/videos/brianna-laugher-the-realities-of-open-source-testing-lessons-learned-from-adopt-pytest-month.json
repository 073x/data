Lack\nof tests holding you back from contributors but you don\u2019t know where\nto start? You\u2019re not alone.\n\n[\u201cAdopt pytest month\u201d][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in \u201cadopt pytest month\u201d. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer\u2019s perspective to veteran contributors.\n\nThis talk will discuss what worked well with \u201cadopt pytest month\u201d,\nwhat didn\u2019t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away\nfor your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or\nan improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and\npytest will be useful.\n\n[1]: http://pytest.org/latest/adopt.html\n[2]: http://pytest.org/latest/",
