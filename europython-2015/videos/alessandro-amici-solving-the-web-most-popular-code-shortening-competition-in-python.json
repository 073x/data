  "description": "Alessandro Amici - Solving the web most popular code shortening competition in Python.\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\n\u201cCode shortening\u201d is the \u201csport\u201d where participants strive to achieve\nthe shortest possible source code that solves a programming problem by\nexploiting all the tricks and quirks of the language.\n\nThe [SIZECON on SPOJ][1] is one of the oldest and most popular code\nshortening problems on the web with a bizarre twist, only character\nabove ASCII value 32 are counted for the penalty. During the talk we\nwill take a journey into some frightening depths of the Python\nlanguage in order to write shorter and shorter solutions to SIZECON\nuntil, exploiting a number of truly mind-blowing tricks, we will reach\nthe current record solution of 28 characters (above ASCII 32!).\n\nI promise I\u2019ll show you the most obfuscated, contrived and sick python\ncode you have ever seen and (hopefully!) will ever see. I invite\nparticipants to give [SIZECON][1] a try and check their score against\nthe [Python2][2] and [Python3][3] SPOJ rankings.\n\n*Slides:* [http://slides.com/alessandroamici/solving-the-web-most-\npopular-shortening-contest-with-python][4]\n\n[1]: http://www.spoj.com/problems/SIZECON/\n[2]: http://www.spoj.com/ranks/SIZECON/lang=PYTH%202.7\n[3]: http://www.spoj.com/ranks/SIZECON/lang=PYTH%203.2.3\n[4]: http://slides.com/alessandroamici/solving-the-web-most-popular-shortening-contest-with-python",
