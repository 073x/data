  "description": "Piotr Dyba - with modern_peripherals: Python and Flask\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nwith modern_peripherals:     Python and Flask\n\nAuto-scrolling sites, glance-following ads, and gesture friendly web\npages are coming!\n\nOver the last few years three products  emerged that enable\ninteraction with computer  in a new way: Myo Armband, Leap Motion\nController and EyeTribe. The Myo Armband is a device that uses the\nelectrical activity in your muscles to wirelessly control your\ncomputer, phone, and tablet, which is especially useful when your\nhands are \"tied\" or dirty.  This device will be used to navigate\nthrough the presentation. The Leap Motion Controller tracks both hands\nin front of the screen.  From a web developer\u2019s perspective, both\ndevices allows us to use gestures, previously  restricted to touch\ndevices, on desktops. EyeTribe is an affordable eye-tracking device.\n\nThe talk will briefly cover setting up SDKs and python wrappers, and\nthen focus on possible uses in daily life, business and, of course,\nweb app development. Code examples will be included. In addition, the\ntrade-offs between processing this new type of input data in the\nclient versus processing input on the server will be discussed.",
