All of the tooling is written in Python.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain a bit about the core idea of Baserock:\ndeclarative system definitions (expressed in YAML) that can be built\nand deployed in various ways.\n\nThen I'll go into more detail about the tools available, and some of\nthe cool things that they can do: distributed building, atomic system\nupdates, creating custom container images, and more.\n\nFind out more about the Baserock project at http://www.baserock.org/",
