It is easy to learn, fast to setup and works great! In the first part of the talk, I will do a super-fast introduction to Ansible for the newcomers.\n\nIf you are a Pythonista, you can hack and leverage Ansible in many\nways. In the second part of the talk, I will describe some options to\nextend and embed Ansible with Python:\n\n- Embedding Ansible with the Python API\n- Extending Ansible: creating modules, dynamic inventory scripts and plugins\n\nPrevious experience with Ansible is advised in order to get the most\nof this talk, but beginners to the tool will also get an overview of\nthe capabilities of this kind of integration.\n\n.. _`Slides here`: http://slides.com/alejandroguiraorodriguez/ee-ansible-with-python#/\n.. _Ansible: http://www.ansible.com/home",
