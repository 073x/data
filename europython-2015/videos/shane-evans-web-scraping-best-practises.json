  "description": "Shane Evans - Web Scraping Best Practises\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPython is a fantastic language for writing web scrapers. There is a\nlarge ecosystem of useful projects and a great developer community.\nHowever, it can be confusing once you go beyond the simpler scrapers\ntypically covered in tutorials.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore some common real-world scraping tasks.\nYou will learn best practises and get a deeper understanding of what\ntools and techniques can be used and how to deal with the most\nchallenging of web scraping projects!\n\nWe will cover crawling and extracting data at different scales - from\nsmall websites to large focussed crawls. This will include an overview\nof automated extraction techniques. We'll touch on common difficulties\nlike rendering pages in browsers, proxy management, and crawl\narchitecture.\n\n**Slides**:  [https://speakerdeck.com/shaneaevans/web-scraping-best-\npractises][1]\n\n[1]: https://speakerdeck.com/shaneaevans/web-scraping-best-practises",
