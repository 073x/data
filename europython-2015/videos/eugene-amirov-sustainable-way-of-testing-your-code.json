  "description": "Eugene Amirov - Sustainable way of testing your code\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nHow to write a test so you would remember what it does in a year from\nnow? How to write selective tests with different inputs? What is test?\nHow to subclass tests cases and yet maintain control on which tests\nwould run? How to extend or to filter inputs used in parent classes?\nAre you a tiny bit intrigued now? :)\n\nThis is not another talk about how to test, but how to organize your\ntests so they were maintainable. I will be using nose framework as an\nexample, however main ideas should be applicable to any other\nframework you choose. Explaining how some parts of code works I would\nhave to briefly touch some advanced python topics, although I will\nprovide need-to-know basics there, so people with any level of python\nknowledge could enjoy the ride.",
