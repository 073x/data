A tourist guide application.\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nOpenCV Python bindings provide several ready to use tools for camera\ncalibration, image recognition and camera position estimation. This\ntalk will show how to recognize a picture, from a library of known\npaintings, and compute the camera position with respect to the\nrecognized picture using OpenCV and numpy. This is applied to a\ntourist guide application for Google Glass through the recognition of\nthe paintings exposed in the museum.",
