The platform is capable of\npersonalizing multi-channel user flows, right-in time targeting and\nanalytics while seamlessly scaling to billions of page impression. It\nis currently tailored to the needs of content providers, but of course\nnot limited to.\n\n- The platform\u2019s architecture is based on four main layers:\n- Proxy/Distribution -- OpenResty/LUA for dynamic request forwarding\n- RESTful API -- several Python applications written using Pyramid web framework running under uWSGI server, which serve as an integration point for third party systems;\n- Analytics -- Python API for Big Data querying and distributed workers performing heavy data collection.\n- In-memory Engine -- CeleraOne\u2019s NoSql database which provides both data storage and fast business logic.\n\nIn the talk I would like to give insights on how we use Python in the\narchitecture, which tools and technologies were chosen, and share\nexperiences deploying and running the system in production.",
