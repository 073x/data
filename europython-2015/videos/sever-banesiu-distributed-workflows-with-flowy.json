  "description": "Sever Banesiu - Distributed Workflows with Flowy\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nThis presentation introduces Flowy, a library for building and running\ndistributed, asynchronous workflows built on top of different backends\n(such as Amazon\u2019s SWF). Flowy deals away with the spaghetti code that\noften crops up from orchestrating complex workflows. It is ideal for\napplications that do multi-phased batch processing, media encoding,\nlong-running tasks, and/or background processing.\n\nWe'll start by discussing Flowy's unique execution model and see how\ndifferent execution topologies can be implemented on top of it. During\nthe talk we'll run and visualize workflows using a local backend.\nWe'll then take a look at what it takes to scale beyond a single\nmachine by using an external service like SWF.",
