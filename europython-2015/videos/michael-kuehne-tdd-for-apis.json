  "description": "Michael Kuehne - TDD for APIs\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIt is always tough to test a complex API comprehensively. The\nadditional level of complexity brings us to the question \"How can we\nvalidate that our API is working as intended?\"\n\nIn this talk I will explain how to use test driven development for\nAPIs to solve this problem and even further how TDD can drive an API\nDesign towards a more usable design.\nI will outline my practical approach with an implementation example\nbased on django. And finally I will give you a brief summary of my\nlessons learned using this approach in customer projects.",
