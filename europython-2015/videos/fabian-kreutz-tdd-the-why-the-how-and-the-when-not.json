  "description": "Fabian Kreutz - TDD - the why, the how and the when not\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nTDD is great, we all know that. But why is it so, and under which\ncircumstances is it ineffective or even harmful?\n\nIn this talk I want to delve into the deeper meaning of testing to\nderive how to do it best.\nAll of this from the point of view of somebody who has profited but\nalso struggled with testing and TDD.\n\nFor every experience level from beginner to advanced there is\nsomething to learn or ponder.",
