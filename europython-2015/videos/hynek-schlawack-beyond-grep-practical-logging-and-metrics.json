  "description": "Hynek Schlawack - Beyond grep: Practical Logging and Metrics\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nKnowing that your application is up and running is great. However in\norder to make informed decisions about the future, you also need to\nknow in what state your application currently is and how its state is\ndeveloping over time.\n\nThis talk combines two topics that are usually discussed separately.\nHowever I do believe that they have a lot of overlap and ultimately a\nsimilar goal: giving you vital insights about your system in\nproduction.\n\nWe'll have a look at their commonalities, differences, popular tools,\nand how to apply everything in your own systems while avoiding some\ncommon pitfalls.\n\n**Slides & Notes**:  [https://hynek.me/talks/beyond-\ngrep/](https://hynek.me/talks/beyond-grep/)",
