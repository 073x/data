  "description": "Timo Stollenwerk - The Butler and the Snake - Continuous Integration for Python\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nContinuous Integration is a software development practice where\nmembers of a team integrate their work frequently, leading to multiple\nintegrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated\nprocess (including tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as\npossible.\n\nThis talk will introduce the basic principles for building an\neffective Continuous Integration system for Python-based projects. It\nwill present the lessons learned from building a Jenkins-based CI\nsystem for an Open Source project with a distributed team of more than\n340 core developers that ranks  among the top 2% of all open source\nprojects worldwide (Plone).",
