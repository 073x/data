Can you trust that 5 star review of fast food chain as\nmuch as the 1 star of a fancy restaurant because \"Toast arrived far\ntoo early, and too thin\"?\n\nWe all like enjoy things differently.  Starting of on the assumption\nthat the \"best pizza\" is not the same for everyone.  Can we group\nusers into people that has similar tastes? Can we identify  reviews\nand restaurants to make sense of it? Can that lead us to a better way\nto find restaurants that you like?\n\nUsing some data handling techniques I walk you through my process and\nresults that I've got from that idea.  There are no requisites for\nthis talk except basic python and math knowledge (matrices exist)",
