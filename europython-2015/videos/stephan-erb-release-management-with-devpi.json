  "description": "Stephan Erb - Release Management with Devpi\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nDevpi is an open source PyPi-compatible package server. Its versatile\nfeatures make it the Swiss Army knife of Python package and release\nmanagement, enabling anyone to shape a custom release workflow.\n\nIn this talk, I will detail how we use our company-wide Devpi\ninstallation in order to share a large set of packages across teams,\ndeploy binary packages to our application servers, and mix and mash\nopen source packages with our own. With Devpi being a critical part of\nour release and deployment infrastructure, I will also cover our high-\navailability setup and how we perform major version updates with\nminimal downtime.\n\nWhile this talk is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction of all\navailable Devpi features, it can offer insights on how Devpi can be\nused at a larger scale.",
