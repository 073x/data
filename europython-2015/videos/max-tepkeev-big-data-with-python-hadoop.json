But what\nexactly is Big Data ? Can we, Pythonistas, enter the wonder world of\nBig Data ? The answer is definitely \"Yes\".\n\nThis talk is an introduction to the big data processing using Apache\nHadoop and Python. We'll talk about Apache Hadoop, it's concepts,\ninfrastructure and how one can use Python with it. We'll compare the\nspeed of Python jobs under different Python implementations, including\nCPython, PyPy and Jython and also discuss what Python libraries are\navailable out there to work with Apache Hadoop.\n\nThis talk is intended for beginners who want to know about Hadoop and\nPython or those who are already working with Hadoop but are wondering\nhow to use it with Python or how to speed up their Python jobs.\n\nSlides for this talk are available [here][1] and code used for\nbenchmarks can be found [here][2].\n[1]: http://www.slideshare.net/maxtepkeev/europython-2015-big-data-with-python-and-hadoop\n[2]: https://github.com/maxtepkeev/talks/tree/master/big-data-with-hadoop-and-python",
