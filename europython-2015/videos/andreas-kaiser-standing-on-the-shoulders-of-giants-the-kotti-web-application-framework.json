  "description": "Andreas Kaiser - Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: The Kotti Web Application Framework\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[20 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nKotti is a high-level, Pythonic web application framework based on\nPyramid, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap 3.  It includes an extensible\nContent Management System called the Kotti CMS.  Kotti is particularly\nwell suited for building custom applications with object level\nsecurity.  It comes with complete user and group management and\nsupports the concepts of global and local roles providing management\nviews for each of those.\n\nThe talk will give an overview on Kotti, its philosophy, history and\nfuture. Target audience are people who want to learn what it is and\ncan be used for.  Because Kotti is just a rather small layer on top of\nits foundations, the talk might also give some interesting insights on\nhow to build a solid (web) framework that suits your personal\npreferences.\n\nReferences:\n\n- http://kotti.pylonsproject.org/\n- http://kotti.readthedocs.org/en/latest/",
