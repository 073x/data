  "description": "Richard Wall - Faking It - The Art of Testing Using Verified Fakes\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nHave you ever worried that your tests aren't as good because they're\nrunning against a fake or mock instead of the real thing?\nVerified fakes solve this problem.\nVerified fakes allow for simplified testing using fakes while still\nproviding the assurance that code tested using a fake implementation\nwill behave the same way when used with a real implementation.\n\nThe talk will begin with a case-study, demonstrating what it means to\nwrite a \"verified fake\" implementation of a public API.\nI will show how to write tests that verify a fake implementation of a\nwell defined API\nand I will show how those same tests can be re-used to verify and test\nreal implementations of the same API.\n\nThe talk will end with a proposal that more libraries should include\nverified fakes.\nI will show, with real-world examples, how verified fakes can be used\nby integrators\nand discuss how they are superior to ad-hoc, unverified, mocking.\n\nDuring the talk I will refer to various real world, Open Source\nexamples. Including:\n\n* Flocker's Pluggable \"Block Device Backend\" [1]\n\nThis API allows Flocker to manipulate file systems on OpenStack\nCinder Blocks and AWS EBS devices.\nIt also makes it easy for third parties to implement their own\nFlocker block device backends.\n\n* Eliot's Memory Logger - and its use in testing and verifying logged messages.\n* LibCloud's DummyNodeDriver - and its limitations.\n* Boto - as an example of a library that could benefit from a verified, introspectable fake.\n* Docker-py - as an example of a library for which we have written a verified fake.\n\nThere will be at least 5 minutes for discussion at the end of the talk.\n\n[1] Flocker is an Open Source Docker orchestration system written in Python by ClusterHQ",
