  "description": "Llu\u00eds Esquerda - CityBikes: bike sharing networks around the world\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[22 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nCityBikes [1] started on 2010 as a FOSS alternative endpoint (and\nAndroid client) to gather information for Barcelona's Bicing bike\nsharing service. Later evolved as an open API [2] providing bike\nsharing data of any (mostly) service worldwide.\n\nFast forward today and after some C&D letters, there's support for\nmore than 200 cities, more than 170M historical entries have been\ngathered for analysis (in approx. a year) and the CityBikes API is the\nmain source for open bike share data worldwide. This talk will tour\nabout how we got there with the help of python and the community [3].\n\nPS: We have a realtime map, it is awesome [4].\n\n[1]: http://citybik.es\n[2]: http://api.citybik.es\n[3]: http://github.com/eskerda/pybikes\n[4]: http://upcoming.citybik.es",
