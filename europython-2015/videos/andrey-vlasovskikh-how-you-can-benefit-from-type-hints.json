  "description": "Andrey Vlasovskikh - How you can benefit from type hints\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[24 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nPEP 484 introduces type hints for Python 3. Type hints can increase\nreadability of our code for both humans and tools and lead to better\nand safer outcomes. And we'll prove it in this talk!\n\nWe're going to take a closer look at type hints, see practical\nexamples of where they can be used and the value they provide.  We'll\nsee that simple class types and built-in collection types are often\nenough for our public API's. We'll also discuss how you can benefit\nfrom type hinting stubs for third-party libraries and briefly cover\nmore advanced scenarios like generic types.",
