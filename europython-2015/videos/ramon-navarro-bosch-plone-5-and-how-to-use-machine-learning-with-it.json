In this talk we are going to explain our approach for\nusing Plone with the Python machine learning toolkit sklearn (http\n://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to enable clusterization and\nclassification of content using a scalable content management system.\nWe will also add some sophisticated front-end gloss using the new\nfunctionalities on frontend development added on Plone 5 and some real\nuse cases of CMS/DMS with machine learning using sklean and solr.",
