  "description": "Ekaterina Tuzova - NumPy: vectorize your brain\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nNumPy is the fundamental Python package for scientific computing.\nHowever, being efficient with NumPy might require slightly changing\nhow you write Python code.\n\nI\u2019m going to show you the basic idioms essential for fast numerical\ncomputations in Python with NumPy. We'll see why Python loops are slow\nand why vectorizing these operations with NumPy can often be good.\n\nTopics covered in this talk will be array creation, broadcasting,\nuniversal functions, aggregations, slicing and indexing.\nEven if you're not using NumPy you'll benefit from this talk.",
