  "description": "Naomi Ceder - Antipatterns for Diversity\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[23 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\n**Stop doing the same thing but expecting different results**\n\nAs developers we put considerable effort into optimisation. We are\nalways tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove\nantipatterns from our code and our development processes.\n\nYet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit\nof optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though\nmost people these days agree that, like good tests, agile\nmethodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a \"good thing\".\n\nMy position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good\ncode there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are,\nhowever, several things that companies and organisations do which\nactually work against diversity. This talk will explore these\nantipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in\nmeritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of\nmarginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of \"culture fit\",\nand an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams,\ncompanies, and organisations might work to combat them.",
