  "description": "Speaker: Stuart Williams\n\nA very fast introduction to Python for software developers with experience in other languages.  Instead of a traditional top-down presentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are immersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using the interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the core language features.  Special attention is given to concepts in Python that often trip up those new to the language.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides",
