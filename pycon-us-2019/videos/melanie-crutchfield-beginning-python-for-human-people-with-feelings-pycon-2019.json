  "description": "Speaker: Melanie Crutchfield\n\nThis tutorial is for people who are **brand new to Python**. It's for people with curioisty to feed, anxiety to overcome, and worlds to change. It's for people named Edna. (And others not named Edna.)\n\nDuring this tutorial you'll be encouraged to **bring your whole self to learning**. We'll start with the very basics of Python, keeping your fingers on the keyboard to gain as much practice as possible. Between strings, functions, and other fun Python-y things, we'll discuss learning deeply, nourishing our brains, and boosting happiness with science.\n\nNo prior experience required; come just as you are. This about being a whole person. It's about learning Python, because Python is really cool. It's also about staying afloat. Being productive. Focusing. It's about finding joy in the error codes.\n\nCome play. It'll be awesome.\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides",
