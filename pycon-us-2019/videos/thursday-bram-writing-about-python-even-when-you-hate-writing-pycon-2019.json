  "description": "Speaker: Thursday Bram\n\nThis tutorial is an introduction to writing about Python: we'll cover potential pitfalls in documentation and other technical writing, practice writing non-technical content (from blog posts to job listings), and testing our writing for readability and accessibility. We'll even cover where writing can fit into your workflow and a few tricks for reducing your writing workload.\n\nAfter this tutorial, you'll be equipped to write about Python for both technical and nontechnical audiences. You might even enjoy writing by the time we're done!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides",
