  "description": "Speaker: Adrian Liaw\n\nPyCuber is a Python package for dealing with Rubik's Cubes, which also contains a built-in solver. Behind these, the implementation of Rubik's Cube's algorithms (formulae) are really important, it provides several useful functions like reverse, mirror, optimise, this talk will cover all these stuffs.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nA secondary school Python coder from Taiwan\n\n\u7d44\u7e54/\u516c\u53f8 \u6728\u523b\u601d\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\n\u982d\u929c Learning Reinforcer \u62cd\u6253\u97ad\u7b56\u9577\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/99",
