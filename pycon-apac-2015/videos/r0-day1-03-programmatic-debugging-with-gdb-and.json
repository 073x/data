  "description": "Speaker: Scott Tsai\n\nTarget Audience: Developers that use both C/C++ and Python\n\nPython is the scripting language of choice for GDB but debugger scripting and programmatic debugging is underutilized in general because not enough developers are both GDB power users and familiar with Python. This talk aims to remedy that.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nDevice driver, firmware, system software developer. Open source contributor, Linux enthusiast. Worked in several Taiwanese consumer electronics companies, a big multinational corporation and a Silicon Valley startup.\n\n\u500b\u4eba\u7db2\u9801\u9023\u7d50 http://scottt.tw/\nTwitter @scottttw\n\u7d44\u7e54/\u516c\u53f8 Awit Systems\n\u982d\u929c Software Developer\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/104",
