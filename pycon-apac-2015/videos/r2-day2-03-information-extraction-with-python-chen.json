  "description": "Speaker: jiawei chen\n\nThis talk will present a named entity recognition (NER) system for extracting attributes and values, like person, company, place or time,  from various of text data. I will introduce how to combine several python tools to build this system. First, use a python written annotation tool BRAT to create a custom annotated corpus. Second, use python to link CRFsuite, training a Conditional Random Fields model to labeling our list of text data, the labeling result will be further analyzed by pandas and scikit-learn.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nA search engineer,  usually like to study machine learning and natural language processing.\n\n\u982d\u929c search engineer\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/61",
