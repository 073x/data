  "description": "MySQL Utilities is both a set of command-line utilities as well as a\nPython library for making the common tasks easy to accomplish. The\nlibrary is written entirely in Python, meaning that it is not necessary\nto have any other tools or libraries installed to make it work. There\nare twenty eight utilites that do everything from copying databases to\nsetting up replilcation with automatic failover in case the master\nserver fails.\n",
