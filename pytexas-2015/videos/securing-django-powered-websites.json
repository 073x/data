  "description": "Becoming an expert in network security is difficult and time-consuming,\nputting it beyond the reach of the average web developer. However,\naddition of just a few lines of code to a django project using the\ndjango-secure package can pre-emptively pick much of an attackers\nlow-hanging fruit. In this meetup, we will secure a simple website using\ndjango-secure, use the command-line tool \"checksecure\" to do a security\naudit, and discuss a few of the attacks django-secure protects against.\nIn the process, we will learn how to use nginx for more robust security\nand discuss how to pass a security audit.\n",
