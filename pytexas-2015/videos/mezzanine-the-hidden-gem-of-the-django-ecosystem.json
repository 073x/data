  "description": "Mezzanine is a very capable content management system built upon a\ndjango foundation, but it is not widely known. While built with\ndevelopers in mind, it has some great features for users. You can get a\nbasic site going with a few static pages and a blog in relatively short\norder. When you're ready, you can extend it to do whatever you like!\nThere are add-on projects Cartridge, a shopping cart; and Drum, a Hacker\nNews/Reddit type site.\n\nWe'll cover:\n\n-  How to get started (\"Mezzanine is just django\")\n-  Why it is a django project and not an app\n-  Customizing with templates\n-  The django page model\n-  Cartridge and Drum\n-  Integrating your own apps\n-  more!\n\n[ This can be made a short talk if that would fit better ]\n",
