  "description": "Topic models are a suite of algorithms that uncover the hidden thematic\nstructure in document collections. These algorithms help us develop new\nways to search, browse and summarize large archives of texts. This talk\nwill introduce topic modeling and one of it's most widely used\nalgorithms called LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Attendees will\nlearn how to use Python to analyze the content of their text documents.\nThe talk will go through the full topic modeling pipeline: from\ndifferent ways of tokenizing your document, to using the Python library\ngensim, to visualizing your results and understanding how to evaluate\nthem.\n",
