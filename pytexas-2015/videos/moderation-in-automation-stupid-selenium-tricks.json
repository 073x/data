  "description": "They say when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When\nusing Selenium, everything looks like a browser automation test.\n\nBrowser automated tests are your slowest tests to run, so when you don't\nneed a web browser, you shouldn't be using Selenium.\n\nWith real world examples, this talk will cover scenarios where Selenium\nis commonly (mis)used, and then recommend the appropriate change in code\nor tool.\n\nWe'll also spend some time on some of the more esoteric features of\nSelenium, and demonstrate a handful of \"Stupid Selenium Tricks\" that\nnobody should ever need to know how to do.\n",
