  "summary": "Deep Learning, anyone who has followed machine learning over the past\nyears has heard it. In this talk I will go past the hype and show what\ndeep learning actually means and how one goes about solving complex\nmachine learning task with a minimum amount of code, with the help of\ntheano, an amazing python library for deep learning. I will show\nexamples from my own research in language and vision, and hope to show\nthat Deep Learning is not only fun, but also not as difficult as one\nmight expect.\n",
