  "description": "Workflows in computational chemistry must manage large quantities of expensively computed and metadata-laden data, each to be accessed in its own right or recycled into complex methodologies. QCDB manages such datasets in collection, application of recognized and exploratory work-up procedures through Pandas, visualization through matplotlib, and facilitation of open-access. It is demonstrated applied to a set of nonbonded structures from the protein databank (PDB).",
