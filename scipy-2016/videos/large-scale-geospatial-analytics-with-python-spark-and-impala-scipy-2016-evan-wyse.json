  "description": "We harnessed the power of three different computing platforms, Spark, Impala, and scientific python, to perform geospatial analysis on mobile phone users. We will discuss data processing techniques for comparing billions of user locations per day with millions of places of interest, easily extractible insights, and methodologies for estimating impacts of treatment on these movement patterns. Our workflow has potential for application for other use cases involving geospatial movement of populations.",
