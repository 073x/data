  "description": "The goal of `SymEngine <https://github.com/symengine/symengine>`_ is to be the fastest C++ symbolic manipulation library (opensource or commercial), compatible with SymPy, that can be used from many languages (Python, Ruby, Julia, ...). We will present the current status of development, how things are implemented internally, why we chose C++, benchmarks, and examples of usage from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and Julia.",
