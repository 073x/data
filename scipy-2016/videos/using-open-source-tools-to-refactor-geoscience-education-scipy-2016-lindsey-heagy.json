  "description": "How do we communicate fundamental concepts in a reproducible, actionable form? How do we put numerical simulation tools in the hands of undergraduate students? These are questions we have been exploring in the development of http://geosci.xyz/, a web-based resource in geophysics that leverages the geophysical software package SimPEG, Sphinx documentation, Jupyter notebooks and Binders to make examples and explanations that are reproducible and interactive.",
