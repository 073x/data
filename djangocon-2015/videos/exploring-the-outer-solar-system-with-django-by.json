  "summary": "Exploring the outer Solar System with Django\n\nI'm a web developer at the Planetary Rings Node, part of the NASA\nPlanetary Data System. Our tiny shop is devoted to archiving,\ncataloging, and distributing scientific data sets relevant to planetary\nring systems. Our base of operations is the SETI Institute, where a\nresearch community is busy searching for and studying life in the\nuniverse.\n\nAt the Rings Node I develop and maintain an outer planets space mission\ndata search tool called OPUS which is built with Django. It lets users\nsearch data, browse images, and access its API via http. I'll talk about\nsome of the reasons for OPUS, some of the challenges we faced in\nbuilding it out and porting it - from a hot mess of php - to what it is\ntoday, and I'll talk a little about our plans for the future.\n\nAnd we'll see some pretty pictures of the outer planets. :-D\n",
