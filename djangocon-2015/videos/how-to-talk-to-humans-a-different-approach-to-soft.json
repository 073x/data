  "summary": "How to talk to humans: a different approach to soft skills by Sharon\nSteed\n\nDevelopers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind.\nWhen you're talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your\ncode and it responds by giving you back what you want. Nine times out of\nten, it works perfectly. Why, then, is it so difficult to do this same\nthing when talking to a client about a project, updating a superior on\nyour progress, or pitching an investor your million-dollar idea? Because\ntalking to people requires a special set of skills - namely, empathy and\na little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled with brilliant\nminds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and brightest\nknow how to tell their compelling story. The takeaways from this\nworkshop will be learning how to value the listener and use\nvulnerability to improve your social connection.\n\nThis talk will take you through the difficulty of broken communication -\nI, myself, stutter and have great difficulty in saying the simplest\nthings - to discovering how to reframe your perceived weaknesses. None\nof us are perfect, but sometimes those things that we feel are our weak\npoints are the exact things that we can use to our advantage.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HH6e/\n",
