  "summary": "But, why is the admin slow?\n\nThis is the general outline I'm working from so far. I think this could\nchange slightly as I develop the talk, but this outline conveys the\ngeneral theme.\n\nIntroduction and display of basic django-debug-toolbar usage (2 min)\n\nThings the admin does well (3 min)\n\nMakes development very fast For many use cases, it \"does the right\nthing\" automatically. For example, modifying the HTML in a callable\nwon't cause new queries. What can sneak up on you (5 min)\n\nHaving lots of related items visible in the list view Using\nlist\\_select\\_related Overriding queryset for additional select\\_related\nand prefetch\\_related options What to avoid in callables (3 min)\n\nQueries that will be executed on every row The default widgets for\nmany-to-many and foreign key fields (3 min)\n\nWhat widgets to use to replace the defaults based on how many options\nyou have in your database Custom aggregates in the list view (i.e.\ncustom querysets) (3 min)\n\nWhen this is a good idea When this is too slow and you need other\noptions More general performance improvements through caching (3-5 min)\n\nDjango's caching framework Caching with third-party packages / tools\nCustom caching with Redis Questions (Remaining time)\n",
