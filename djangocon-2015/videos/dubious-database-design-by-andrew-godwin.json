  "summary": "Dubious Database Design by Andrew Godwin\n\nEveryone has seen plenty of articles about how to design data storage\nsolutions well - but nobody is getting up there and talking about how\nbad their storage design is.\n\nRather than just listen to more things to do and vague reasons why, come\nand see some truly awful examples of storage design, and the lessons we\ncan learn from it. What happens when you end up reimplementing indexes?\nWhy shouldn't you turn off durability? Why not make a table for every\nuser? And how can you render templates purely in the database?\n\nAll this, and more, as we delve into the realm of datastores and\nexamples both historic and current that you can learn from, and\nhopefully come away with a better idea why the rest of us design things\nthe way we do.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HGSe/\n",
