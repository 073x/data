  "summary": "Jane Austen on PEP8: Tips from an English Major on Writing Better Code\n\nI have two English degrees, and I\u2019ve identified some concrete ways this\nmakes me a better developer. This talk will discuss how we can take\nlessons from literature to write more readable code, make better tests,\nand create more usable websites.\n\nI\u2019ll compare Two Scoops of Django to Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of\nStyle, that familiar freshman comp text, to explore how they are more\nalike than they are different. We\u2019ll discuss the importance of\nreadability, creating a \u201cstory arc\u201d in your tests through good user\nstories, how variables names have characterization, and the importance\nof whitespace and good formatting to everyone. I\u2019ll also compare PEP8 to\nthe MLA Handbook; there\u2019s a reason both disciplines have a style guide!\n",
