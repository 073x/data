  "description": "While community management and developer relations are gaining acceptance, many companies still don't know how these efforts can benefit not only the communities of the open source projects on which their business relies but also their productivity and profitability.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll look at community from a business perspective, including the effect community can have on an organization's bottom line. Although there are communities everywhere, I'll approach the topic\u2014meaning, communities, their members, and their contributors\u2014from a free/open source perspective. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover:\r\n\r\n* Business reasons for supporting a community\r\n* Metrics for gauging community management success from the business' perspective\r\n* Getting started in community management\r\n* Risks of community management\n\n",
