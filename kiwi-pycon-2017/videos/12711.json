  "description": "Steve wolfram asserted that all machines can be classified ito one of four classes. However classification has been shown to be undecidable.  I suggest we can separate complex machines into class III and class IV. I use this ability to analyse the role of recombination in resistance to ageing and the role of recombination in arms races",
