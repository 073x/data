  "description": "BigQuery is a Google tool to quickly analyse large sets of data. A web console and CLI tools are available, but we can also use BigQuery's remote API and Python libraries. In this talk we will introduce BigQuery and use Python to manage a project and analyse some data. Most of the examples found online are either too basic or very advanced. We hope to land somewhere between those extremes.",
