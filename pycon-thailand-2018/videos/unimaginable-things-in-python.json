Or have you ever found yourself writing code that works but you don't know why? This talk will explore weird behaviors in Python, and in some cases, how to exploit them.\nDescription: We will talk about obscure mistakes/bugs Python programmers may produce.\n- What actually happens and what could go wrong when we use\n  comprehension-style syntax?\n\n- What is so scary about nested functions with duplicate variable names?\n- What is wrong with creating a sequence of lambdas from list comprehension syntax (e.g. `adders = [ lambda x: x + i for i in range(10) ]`)?\n- What would you do if you want to delete elements in a dictionary according to some predicate functions?\n- What happens when you mix generator functions with with-statements?\n- and more!!\nhttps://github.com/groupw66/talks-pycon-th-2018\n\n\n------------\n\nBio:\nProgrammer: Specialized in problem solving, algorithm and data structure. Interested in robotics.",
