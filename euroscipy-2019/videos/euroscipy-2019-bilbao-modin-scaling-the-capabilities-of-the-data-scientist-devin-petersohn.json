Some of these optimizations, however, are counterproductive to the end user\u2019s workflow and thought process. In this talk, we discuss the design of Modin, a DataFrame library, and how to optimize for the human system.\n\nModin is a project at UC Berkeley's RISELab designed to optimize for the data scientist\u2019s time. Often when building a data system, the system designers will follow a set of \u201cbest practices\u201d in order to optimize performance. These \u201cbest practices\u201d often require data scientists to understand and personally optimize concepts and system components that are not central to extracting value from their data.\n\nThe fundamental goal of data science is to extract value from data. Despite this, data systems are being built with user requirements such as: (1) knowledge of partitioning, (2) understanding laziness and what triggers computation, (3) an entirely new API, and (4) where their code is running (e.g. locally, on-prem cluster, cloud). This overhead is passed to the data scientist, even though there is no overlap between these new requirements and the fundamental goal of their profession.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how we think about the problem of large scale data science and optimizing for the human system. We will discuss the system design of Modin, which enables pluggable backends, runtimes, and APIs. The system is designed to solve the needs of the data science community regardless of an individual user\u2019s environment. Currently, Modin supports the pandas API, and a proof of concept for SQL has been implemented. Modin is completely open-source and can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/modin-project/modin. \n\nGit \u2013 https://github.com/modin-project/modin \nDomains \u2013 Big Data, Open Source \nDomain Expertise \u2013 none \nPython Skill Level \u2013 basic \nAbstract as a tweet \u2013 Modin, a DataFrame library, and how to optimize for the human system.",
