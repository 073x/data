  "description": "EuroSciPy 2019 Bilbao \nSeptember 4, Wednesday \nOteiza Track. Talk. 15:15\n\nDashboarding with Jupyter notebooks, voila and widgets\nMaarten Breddels and Martin Renou\n\nTurn your Jupyter notebook into a beautiful modern React or Vue based dashboard using voila and Jupyter widgets.\n\nSharing the result of a Jupyter notebook is currently not an easy path. With voila we are changing this. Voila is a small but important ingredient in the Jupyter ecosystem. Voila can execute notebooks, keeping the kernel connected but does not allow for arbitrary code execution, making it safe to share your notebooks with others.\nWith new libraries built on top of Jupyter widgets/ipywidgets (ipymaterialui and ipyvuetify) we allow beautiful modern React and Vue components to enter the Jupyter notebook. Using voila we can integrate the ipywidgets seamlessly into modern React and Vue pages, to build modern dashboards directly from a Jupyter notebook.\n\nI will give a live example on how to transform a Jupyter notebook into a fully functional single page application with a modern (Material Design) look.\n\nDomains \u2013 Big Data, Data Visualisation, General-purpose Python, Jupyter, Open Source \nDomain Expertise \u2013 none \nPython Skill Level \u2013 basic \nProject Homepage / Git \u2013 https://github.com/QuantStack/voila/ \nAbstract as a tweet \u2013 Turn your Jupyter notebook into a beautiful modern #React or #Vue based dashboard using #voila and Jupyter widgets.",
