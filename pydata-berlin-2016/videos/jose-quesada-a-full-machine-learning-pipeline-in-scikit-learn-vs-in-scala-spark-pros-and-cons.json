What advantages does Spark.ml offer over scikit-learn?\n\nAt Data Science Retreat we've taken a real-world dataset and worked through the stages of building a predictive model -- exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model fitting -- in several different frameworks. We'll show what it's like to work with native Spark.ml, and compare it to scikit-learn along several dimensions: ease of use, productivity, feature set, and performance.\n\nIn some ways Spark.ml is still rather immature, but it also conveys new superpowers to those who know how to use it.",
