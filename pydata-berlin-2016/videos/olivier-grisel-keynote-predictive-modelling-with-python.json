  "description": "PyData Berlin 2016\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.\n\nSlides: http://ogrisel.github.io/decks/2016_pydata_berlin/\n\nhttps://github.com/ogrisel/docker-distributed",
