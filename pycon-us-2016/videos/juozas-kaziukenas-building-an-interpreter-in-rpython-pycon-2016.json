  "description": "Speaker: Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas\n\nTo understand how dynamic programming languages get executed I set out to build a PHP interpreter. Not a joke, I really did it and it worked! The final result was a well-tested piece of Python code, which could be compiled to be very performant as well.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to introduce you to the basics of interpreters and the tools available in RPython to build one.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
