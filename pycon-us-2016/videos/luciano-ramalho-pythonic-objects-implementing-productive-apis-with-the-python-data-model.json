  "description": "Speaker: Luciano Ramalho\n\nPython is so consistent that often we can infer the behavior of new objects by assuming they work as the built-ins. The Python Data Model is the foundation of this consistent behavior. This talk presents the construction of Pythonic objects: classes that feel \"\"natural\"\" to a Python programmer, and leverage some of the best language features by implementing key protocols of the Data Model.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
