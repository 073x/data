  "description": "Speaker: Felix Crux\n\nAnyone who uses Open Source has run into software licenses. Too often, our understanding of this mess of legalese is incomplete, confused, or based on bad assumptions. But we can\u2019t ignore them: licenses govern everything about how we use others\u2019 code \u2014 and how they use ours. Come learn the basics of copyright, what different licenses let you do, and why & how you should choose one for your code!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
