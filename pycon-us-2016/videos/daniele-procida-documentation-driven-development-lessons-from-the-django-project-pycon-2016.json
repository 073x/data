  "description": "Speaker: Daniele Procida\n\nOne secret of Django's success is the quality of its documentation. As well as being key to the quality of the code itself, it has helped drive the development of Django as a community project, and even the professional development of programmers who adopt Django.\n\nI'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can easily win the same benefits.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
