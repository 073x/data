  "description": "Speaker: Tyler Reddy\n\nComputational geometry deals with the algorithms used to solve a diverse set of problems in geometry. Applications range from robotics (visibility) and geographic information systems to game development (collision detection) and medical research. This tutorial will introduce computational geometry, the related tools available in the Python ecosystem, and identify areas for improvement.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
