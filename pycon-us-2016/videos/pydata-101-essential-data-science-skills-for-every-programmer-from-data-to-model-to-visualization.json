  "description": "Speakers: Andy Terrel, Christine Doig\n\nData Science is fun and with the PyData toolset something you can start to build with in an afternoon. Join us as we start with a few datasets, learn how to munge, model, and materialize into simple web applications for predictions. At the end of the day you will come away with a solid understanding of the PyData ecosystem and tools used everyday by data scientists.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
