  "description": "Speaker: Alex Gaynor\n\nAs developers, we make programs which do things. But we don't build nearly enough programs to make our own jobs easier. Once, not all that long ago, we didn't even have continuous integration servers. This talk will go through what types of new specialized tools we, as developers, can and should be building to make our jobs better.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
