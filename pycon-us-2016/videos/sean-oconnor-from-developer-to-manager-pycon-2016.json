  "description": "Speaker: Sean O'Connor\n\nAs developers move along in their career, they will often be given the chance to move into management. This can be great, but it can also end in tears. In this talk we'll follow one developer's journey into management. Through that process we'll explore what one should think about before embarking on their own journey as well as some lessons for those who do decide to go down the management path.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
