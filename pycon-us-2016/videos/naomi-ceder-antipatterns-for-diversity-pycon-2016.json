  "description": "Speaker: Naomi Ceder\n\nJust as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increase diversity. There are, however, several things we (yes, even in the Python community) do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these anti-patterns for diversity,  as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organizations might work to combat them.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
