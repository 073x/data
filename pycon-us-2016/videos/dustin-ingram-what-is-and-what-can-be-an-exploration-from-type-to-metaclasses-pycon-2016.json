  "description": "Speaker: Dustin Ingram\n\nMost of us use `type` every day, but few can say they know it well. This talk explores `type` and along the way, reveals how it relates to `object`, `class` and more, eventually arriving at deeper understanding of metaclasses in Python.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
