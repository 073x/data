  "description": "Speaker: Christian Heimes\n\nHave you ever wondered how the OS manages open files and network connections, what this 'file descriptor' thing actually is all about, or what's so special about Unix sockets? In my talk I will give you a quick tour into the I/O layer and process model of Unix-like operating systems. You will learn how to securely identify and efficiently share resources between processes.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
