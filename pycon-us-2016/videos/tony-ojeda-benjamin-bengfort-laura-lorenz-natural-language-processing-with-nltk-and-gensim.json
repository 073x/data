  "description": "Speakers: Tony Ojeda, Benjamin Bengfort, Laura Lorenz\n\nIn this tutorial, we will begin by exploring the features of the NLTK library. We will then focus on building a language-aware data product - a topic identification and document clustering algorithm from a web crawl of blog sites. The clustering algorithm will use a simple Lesk K-Means clustering to start, and then will improve with an LDA analysis using the popular Gensim library.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
