  "description": "Speaker: Katie Bell\n\nWhen writing systems to test if beginner programmers' code was correct, I didn't expect to need numpy, scipy a custom C module and a whole lot of cool geometry algorithms. Giving actionable feedback on tasks (in this case logo/turtle vector drawings), is necessary for the learning process and goes some fun places. Take this as a case study of writing efficient geometry number crunching in Python.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
