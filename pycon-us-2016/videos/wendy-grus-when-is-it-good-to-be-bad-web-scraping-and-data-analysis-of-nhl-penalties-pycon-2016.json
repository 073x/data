  "description": "Speaker: Wendy Grus\n\nOn Jan. 20, Philadelphia Flyers forward Zac Rinaldo was ejected from a game after boarding Penguins defenseman Kris Letang. The Flyers came back to win. After the game, Rinaldo said he \"\"changed the game\"\" (for which he was suspended 8 games). Using Python for webscraping and data analysis, I explore data from 10 NHL seasons to investigate how hockey penalties affect the outcome of the game.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
