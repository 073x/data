  "description": "Speaker: Anna Herlihy\n\nThe LLVM Project provides an intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) that can be compiled on many platforms. LLVM-IR is used by analytical frameworks to achieve language and platform independence. What if we could add Python to the long list of languages that can be translated to LLVM-IR? This talk will go through the steps of wrestling Python into LLVM-IR with a simple, static one-pass compiler.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
