  "description": "Speaker: Luke Sneeringer\n\nAnsible has become one of the most popular tools available for deploying applications and otherwise managing large numbers of servers. Its agentless nature means that the only thing you need on a server to be able to orchestrate it is SSH. This tutorial will get you started with Ansible, first by covering the concepts, and then by deploying a non-trivial application together.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
