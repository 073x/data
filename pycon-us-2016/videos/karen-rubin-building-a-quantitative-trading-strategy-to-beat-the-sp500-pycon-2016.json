  "description": "Speaker: Karen Rubin\n\nTwo years ago, Karen embarked on a project to learn how to research, write and trade algorithms to invest in the market. She re-learned python and explored what would happen if you invested in women-led companies over a 12-year period. In this talk, she will walk through the highs and lows of her journey from initial data gathering, through writing a strategy to validation and trading.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
