  "description": "Speaker: Geoff Gerrietts\n\nAs a young engineer interested in performance, much of the advice I saw on performance management focused on algorithms and rules of thumb. It\u2019s good advice, but it doesn\u2019t address the most common problems. This talk will cover a handful of the most common performance problems I\u2019ve encountered in my career. We will talk about how to recognize them, what causes them, and how to resolve them.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
