  "description": "Speaker: Doug Hellmann\n\nSmiley spys on your application, recording everything it does, using Python's built-in tracing facility and a database to create a complete record of your program's runtime so you can study it. Most of the tools I used to create Smiley are in Python's standard library, and the history of Smiley's development serves as a framework to discuss those tools and how you can tap their power yourself.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
