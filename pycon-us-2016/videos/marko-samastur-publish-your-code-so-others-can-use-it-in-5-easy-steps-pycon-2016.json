  "description": "Speaker: Marko Samastur\n\nAs developers we all love well-documented, well-tested packages. If we do the same for our code it is easier for others to re-use our hard work, and maybe even contribute. We will take a quick look on how to do this using popular tools and only a small investment of time. With Github and some simple tools, setting up a well-groomed package doesn't have to be difficult.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
