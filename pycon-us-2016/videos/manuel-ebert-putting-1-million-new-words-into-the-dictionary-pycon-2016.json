  "description": "Speaker: Manuel Ebert\n\n2015 was the year of spocking, amabots, dadbuds, and smol. Like half of all english words used every day, these words are not in the dictionary. Until we put them there. In this talk, I\u2019ll describe how we found definitions for 1 Million words that were missing from dictionaries, what it takes to do Natural Language Processing at that scale, and how to be the least popular scrabble winner.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
