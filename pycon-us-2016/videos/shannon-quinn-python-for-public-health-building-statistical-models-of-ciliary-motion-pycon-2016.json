  "description": "Speaker: Shannon Quinn\n\nCilia, microscopic hairs lining nearly every cell surface in your body, play a major role in developmental and sinopulmonary health. As such, deriving quantitative properties of their motion is compelling for both clinical and research purposes. Here we demonstrate a computational pipeline built entirely in Python for analyzing ciliary motion using a variety of machine learning techniques.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
