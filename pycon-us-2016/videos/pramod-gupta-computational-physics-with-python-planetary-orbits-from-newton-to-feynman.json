  "description": "Speaker: Pramod Gupta\n\nNewton's explanation of planetary orbits is one of the greatest achievements of science. We will follow Feynman's approach to show how the motion of the planets around the sun can be calculated using computers and without using Newton's advanced mathematics. This talk will convince you that doing physics with Python is way more fun than the way you did physics in high school or university.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
