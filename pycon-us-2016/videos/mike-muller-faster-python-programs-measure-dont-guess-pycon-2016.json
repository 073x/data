  "description": "Speaker: Mike M\u00fcller\n\nOptimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory.\nDeveloping a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques\nas well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation\nfor a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.\nExamples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
