  "description": "Speaker: Clara Bennett\n\nGit is a powerful source control tool, but the learning curve can be steep. This talk introduces the underpinnings of git, to provide a foundation for more confident and effective git use. My hypothesis is that having a solid mental model of what git is actually doing under the hood helps you more easily learn to use advanced git features.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
