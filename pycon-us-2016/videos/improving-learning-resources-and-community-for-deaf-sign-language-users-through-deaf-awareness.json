  "description": "Speaker: Sarah Jessica Leivers\n\nDeaf people are underrepresented in programming roles and in the wider CS community. There are extra obstacles that Deaf people face when learning to code and integrating/networking within the industry. Python might be ideal for teaching Deaf people to program, and with the help of some Deaf Aware Pythonistas, the Python community might be the ideal place for Deaf programmers to feel included.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
