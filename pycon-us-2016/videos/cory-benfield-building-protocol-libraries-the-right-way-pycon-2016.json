  "description": "Speaker: Cory Benfield\n\nOne of the great strengths of the Python ecosystem is the enormous collection of powerful, flexible libraries. However, these libraries tend to suffer from one extremely common design flaw that mean that the work done is not easily re-usable or transferable. In this talk, we talk about how to build libraries that can be used as widely as possible, through the lens of the Python Hyper HTTP project.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
