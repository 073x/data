  "description": "When I set out to bring Django Girls to the city of Tijuana, I never\nexpected to find so many programmers. Even more unexpected was a small\ngroup of Python/Django developers I found, passionate about kickstarting\nthe Python community in Baja California. As Django Girls (and later,\nDjango Girls Ensenada) came and went, I learned more about the Django\ncommunity in other cities of Mexico, including the reason why I never\nheard of them before organizing the workshop.\n",
