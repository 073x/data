  "description": "One night, in September 2007, I read every page of Django's\ndocumentation and the entire (then draft) Django Book. Over the next few\nyears I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a\ncore developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely\nuninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time\nwith Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from\nemailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already\nhappened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric\nFlorenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to\nslowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer.\n",
