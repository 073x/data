  "description": "You might have heard of Machine Learning from your co-worker or in a\nlocal meetup and are enticed to get started but not sure how to take\nthat first step. Confused between different sources, where to start from\nor how to proceed given a particular problem statement or dataset, then\nthis talk is for you. It is aimed at complete beginners ( maybe you? )\nwho are just starting in machine learning and are ready to commit.\n\nThe talk will go something like this - each of the following items will\nbe explained how it\u2019s useful and why we should use it. Then alongside\nshowcase, that same step applied to the real example(dataset) of that\nparticular item so that the audience will be able to grasp the idea. It\nwill add to around 35 minutes leaving us with 10 minutes for Q&A.\n\n1) | Context ( 5 mins ):\n   | Discuss why we need Machine Learning and how we can use Machine\n     Learning in different domains.\n\n2) | Resources ( 3 mins):\n   | Talks about the dataset availability, online competitions, and Open\n     Source libraries such as Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Keras.\n\n3) Jupyter Notebook (25 mins):\n   This Jupyter notebook will be a great starting point for most\n   Supervised Machine Learning projects that involve common tasks: a)\n   Imports and data loading (2 mins )\n\nb) Data Exploration (5 mins)\nc) Data Cleaning (3 mins)\nd) Feature Engineering (4 mins)\ne) Model Exploration (6 mins)\nf) Final Model Building and Prediction ( 5 mins)\n\n4) | Wrap up ( 2 mins ):\n   | Finalizing my talk, sharing some tips etc.\n\n5) | Q&A ( 10 mins ):\n   | Question and Answering with the Audience.\n\nHope to inspire the audience to get started with machine learning,\nexplore different domains, to learn, to create and engage with the\nMachine Learning Community.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 17:00 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
