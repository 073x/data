  "description": "At the December 2018 Python Frederick event, Patrick walked through the second half of the Django 2.1 tutorial. Since Patrick is a DevOps engineer instead of a web developer, the group got to share in the experience in a novice.\n\nThe Django tutorial is very large so we picked up from where we left off from the previous presentation. If you want to watch that experience, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSs2eZ-yFps&index=2&list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wMFhbiedpMgh2VRT5uICuF.\n\nPython Frederick is the Python user group in Frederick, MD. You can learn more about the group at https://www.pythonfrederick.org/.",
