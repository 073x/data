  "description": "At our March 2018 event, Matt Layman spoke to the group about how to build a portfolio website using Pelican and Netlify for the cost of a domain name.\n\nThe recording was interrupted when a display cable was pulled, but the first portion of the talk outlines most of the parts and process are included so we decided to publish it anyway.\n\nNote: requirement.txt should have been requirements.txt (with an s character). This was an oversight and fixed later in the talk.",
