  "description": "For years, lawyers and attorneys working in Switzerland have sensed that cases of migrants appealing deportation weren't treated equally by the 24 judges of the Swiss Federal Administrative Court.\n\nTo explore this claim we scraped the 30'000 verdicts of the court since 2007 from the court's data base. Then used the Python libraries pandas, glob and regular expressions to explore the data.\"\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 17th, 2017.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International",
