  "description": "PyData London 2016\n\nWorking from the premise that the fruits of your data explorations find their natural home on the web, this talk will discuss a few modern work-flows that deliver your data to the browser. I'll be aiming to distil a few of the things I learned in the last year while writing the book 'Data-visualisation with Python and JavaScript' and highlighting some of the key changes that have occurred in the Python and JS dataviz ecosystems in that little time.\n\nIf you take dataviz seriously I think you have to engage and make friends with JavaScript. The good news for Pythonistas is that Modern JS (EcmaScript 6) has 'borrowed' more than a few of Python's clothes, which makes moving between the two languages that much easier. I'll demonstrate a few of these, showing bilingual development is getting less and less arduous.",
