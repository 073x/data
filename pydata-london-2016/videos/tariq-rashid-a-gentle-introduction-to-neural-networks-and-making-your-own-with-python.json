  "description": "PyData London 2016\n\nNeural networks are not only a powerful data science tool, they're at the heart of recent breakthroughs in deep learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThis talk, designed for a complete beginners and anyone non-technical, will introduce the history and ideas behind neural networks. You won't need anything more than basic school maths. We'll gently build our own neural network in Python too.\n\nIdeas: - search for intelligence machines, what's easy for us not easy for computers.\n\nDIY: - MINST dataset - simple network 3 layer - matrix multiplication to aid calculations - preprocessing, priming weights - 95% accuracy with very simple code! - improvements lead to 98% accuracy!\n\nsource code will be online Python 3 notebook on makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.com and @myoneuralnet\n\nSlides available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mai96er3d9Tca6mwVaO_bI7nZ09L6QQbww233yAnaGg/edit\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork",
