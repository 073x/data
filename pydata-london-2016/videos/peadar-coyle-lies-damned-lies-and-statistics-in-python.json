  "description": "PyData London 2016\n\nJoin Peadar as he talks you through how to do good statistical analysis with Statsmodels, scikit-learn and PyMC3\n\nWe'll compare and debug models (logistic regression and more advanced versions) in three different statistics packages in Python.\n\nPeadar will show you how Python can help you fake statistics without having to open up your graduate textbook :)\n\nStatistical inference is a fundamental tool in science and engineering, but it is often poorly understood. This tutorial will take you from first principles through how to do good statistical analysis in Python.\n\nBoth frequentist and Bayesian versions will be included, and attendees will leave the talk with a good understanding of statistical inference, how to use Scikit-learn, Statsmodels and PyMC3.\n\nThis will be an entire case study comparing three different libraries for solving the same regression problem.\n\nAttendees should bring a Laptop with Anaconda installed and the latest version of Scikitlearn, PyMC3 and Scikit-Learn.\n\nSlides available here: http://slides.com/springcoil/deck-17#/\n\nGitHub Repo:  https://github.com/springcoil/PyDataLondonTutorial",
