  "description": "PyData London 2016\n\nIn this session Mark will show how to build a meetup.com recommendation engine using Neo4j and Python.\n\nOur solution will be a hybrid which makes uses of both content based and collaborative filtering to come up with multi layered recommendations that take different datasets into account e.g. we'll combine data from the meetup.com and twitter APIs.\n\nWe'll evolve the solution from scratch and look at the decisions we make along the way in terms of modelling and coming up with factors that might lead to better recommendations for the end user.",
