What do you do then? How do you make your first production build instead of re-using your development one? is your code ready to handle real user interactions?\nThis talk will show a production ready checklist for your Python code; what to look for when creating a production-ready Docker image; what are the differences between development and production environments and builds.\nYou will see how to deal with exceptions, logs, and metrics with real-world use cases.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
