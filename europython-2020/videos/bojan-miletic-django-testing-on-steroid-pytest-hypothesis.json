We'll go over the details, how you can use them to detect edge cases, extend test coverage and if time allows it how you can use them to test django models.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \"",
