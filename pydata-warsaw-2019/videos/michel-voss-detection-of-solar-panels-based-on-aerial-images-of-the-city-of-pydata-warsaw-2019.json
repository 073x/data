  "description": "Full Title - Detection of solar panels based on aerial images of the city of Pozna\u0144 using deep neural networks\n\nThe main goal of the article is to present the results of a study on the use of deep learning networks to detect solar panels based on aerial images of Poznan. In addition, the main motivation is to obtain more detailed information about the use of solar energy in Poland drawing on big data sources, which until now have not been used for this purpose.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
