  "description": "Full title - Mateusz Otmianowski and Mikolaj Olszewski: How to efficiently model learner\u2019s knowledge with recurrent neural networks\n\nDuring our presentation we will share the results and experiences connected with implementing state-of-the-art techniques for modelling learners knowledge using Recurrent Neural Networks (Deep Knowledge Tracing).\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
