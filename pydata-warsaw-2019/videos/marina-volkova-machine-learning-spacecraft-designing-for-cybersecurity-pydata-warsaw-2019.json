  "description": "In the field of cybersecurity, data scientists use computational methods to develop more effective ways to find security threats hidden in data flows of IT network communications. This talk, focused on data scientists, will provide a moderately technical representation of how machine learning and data science solve real-life problems, demonstrating how threat detection is enriched and improved through machine learning and data science.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
