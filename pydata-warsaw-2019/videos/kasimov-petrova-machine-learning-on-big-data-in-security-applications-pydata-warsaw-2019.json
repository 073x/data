  "description": "Full title - Yury Kasimov and Olga Petrova: Machine Learning on big data in security applications \n\nIn this talk, we describe how Python in combination with Apache Spark helps Avast to fight bad guys. We demonstrate different use cases how we apply machine learning to a wide range of security applications from anomaly detection on time series to clustering of malicious files.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
