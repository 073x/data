  "description": "www.pydata.org\n\nMany of us knows how to train & deploy ML models in cloud, but doing so have we become redundant. Running multiple experiments in single machine & waiting for tasks to complete cannot be time-efficient for big datasets. Hence, we need an automation which can take over repetitive manual tasks & spare us the time to do other important stuff. Aim is to show how to deploy ML architecture in 60 SECONDS\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
