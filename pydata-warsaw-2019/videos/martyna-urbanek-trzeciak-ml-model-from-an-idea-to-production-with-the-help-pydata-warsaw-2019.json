  "description": "Full title - Martyna Urbanek-Trzeciak: ML model from an idea to production with the help of Python\n\nWe will talk about how Python can be helpful in the machine learning projects on every step of the process starting with the idea where data-driven predictions can be helpful, through data preparation, data modelling, communication of the results using various visualizations and implementation on production including monitoring of model performance.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
