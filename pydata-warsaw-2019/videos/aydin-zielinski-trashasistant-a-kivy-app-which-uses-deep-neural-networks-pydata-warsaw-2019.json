  "description": "Full title - Olgun AYDIN and Krystian Zieli\u0144ski: TrashAsistant: A kivy App, which uses Deep Neural Networks, for helping trash segregation\n\nWe have developed a mobile application using kivy framework. It uses Deep Neural Networks to help segregating trashes. Thanks to this app, before throwing trash to specific bin, you will know which trash bin you should throw to. Only thing you will do is just taking a photo of the trash via the app.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
