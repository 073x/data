I will introduce morality and ethics and will give examples in which areas artificial intelligence - or better phrased machine learning - is leading and will lead to ethical challenges. I will focus in my talk especially on the developer\u00b4s perspective: What are special ethical challenges developers will be facing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
