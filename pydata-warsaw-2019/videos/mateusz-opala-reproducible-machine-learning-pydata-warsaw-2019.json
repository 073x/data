  "description": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific methods. Especially in production Machine Learning it's crucial to ensure that hidden source of randomness is not a real reason for a model performance improvement. In my talk I will elaborate on importance of reproducibility and show how we build reproducible machine learning pipelines at Netguru.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
