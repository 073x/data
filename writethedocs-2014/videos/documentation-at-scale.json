  "description": "Information is powerful \u2014 every day we see it transform the world around us.\n\nDocumentation doesn't always have to be about a software workflow or open source project \u2014 it can be used to develop and convey ideas much larger than yourself. Information architecture is a powerful tool for developing ideas over time. It enables us to evolve and distill information at a much larger scale than a single person or team could ever achieve on their own.\n\nTake these concepts, and apply open source workflow tools like GitHub's Pull Requests and Write the Docs, and the distributed evolution of ideas and information has never been more accessible.\n\nWe'll explore these concepts, learn how to foster a community of distributed contributors, encourage contributions early on, and more.\n\nPython-Guide.org will be used as an example, a Python-specific knowledge base written by 168 people and accessed by over 50,000 people every month.",
