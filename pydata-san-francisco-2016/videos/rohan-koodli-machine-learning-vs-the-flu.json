I wanted to create a better way for scientists to make flu vaccines. My solution was to predict future flu genetic sequences so that scientists could easily analyze flu sequences and create vaccines. The main topics will include the use of Biopython and scikit-learn in a scientific environment, as well as data preprocessing and model selection.\n\nEvery year, millions of people are affected by the flu. Every year, we take a vaccine to possibly gain immunity from that year\u2019s flu. However, the vaccines may not always work. In recent years, people have made attempts at predicting how the influenza virus has changed. For example, every year, world health officials try to predict what drugs to include in the coming year\u2019s vaccine. However, many of the methods used have been called \u201cquestionable\u201d by the National Institutes of Medicine. So, my goal in this project was to come up with a better way for scientists to make flu vaccines.\n\nIn my talk, I will show how I used Python to implement my flu prediction algorithm, as well as how I used libraries to make my algorithm more efficient and simpler in every step.",
