We use a pre-trained DCNN on two very different domain specific datasets, and apply fine-tuning to transfer the learned features to the prediction. Our approach improves prediction accuracy on both domain-specific datasets, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nIn this talk, we propose prediction techniques using deep learning on different types of images datasets \u2013 medical images and fashion images. \n\nWe show how to build a generic deep learning model, which could be used with:\n\n1. A fluorescein angiographic eye image to predict Diabetic Retinopathy \n2. A fashion image to predict the clothing type in that image \n\nWe propose a method to apply a pre-trained deep convolution neural network (DCNN) on images to improve prediction accuracy.
