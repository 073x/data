  "description": "Holding a conference needs continuous efforts, especially when you're in\ncharge of all those administration stuff. Simple solutions could end up\nwith management death spiral, while complex systems like Redmine would\nbe an overkill. Roboconf is the home-made solution we've brought up: a\nconference operation site built upon Django, with issue tracking,\ndocument organizing, notifications, and staff management all in one\nplace. In this session, I'll describe situations we faced when\norganizing SITCON 2013, how Roboconf got itself implemented, what\ndifference it has made throughout the process, and crazy stuff other\nfolks at SITCON built around this system.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nLaw student at NTU, Administration Lead at SITCON '13/'14, open source\nadvocate.\n\nRSChiang\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c31\u8b80\u65bc\u81fa\u7063\u5927\u5b78\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b78\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728 SITCON 2013\u30012014\n\u64d4\u4efb\u884c\u653f\u7d44\u9577\uff1b\u539f\u5148\u662f\u500b\u62ff\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u505a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u666e\u901a\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\uff0c\u53bb\u5e74\u6691\u5047\u7684\u67d0\u5929\u7a81\u7136\u8f49\u8077\u6210\u9375\u76e4\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5617\u8a66\u5728\u5b78\u6821\u63a8\u5ee3\u958b\u6e90\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u662f\u70ba\u4e86\u4e0d\u8f9c\u8ca0\u723a\u723a\u7684\u540d\u8072\u5427\u3002\n",
