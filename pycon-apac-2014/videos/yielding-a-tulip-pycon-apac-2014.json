  "description": "Asynchronised operations are good. Callbacks are not. Named callbacks\nclutter scopes and are disruptive. Anonymous callbacks create deeply\nnested code and become totally unreadable\u2014Python does not even support\nthat because it just lacks style! We deserve better. Let's take a look\non how Python 3.4's new \"asyncio\" (aka Tulip) brings elegance to async\ntasks.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTP is a professional software engineer enjoying building things. He\nwrites C++ because his boss pays him to do so, but loves Python and\nconstantly tries to sneak it into his work as much as he can.\n\n\u500b\u4eba\u7db2\u9801\u9023\u7d50\n\nhttps://uranusjr.com/ Twitter @uranusjr \u7d44\u7e54/\u516c\u53f8 BIMETEK Co.
