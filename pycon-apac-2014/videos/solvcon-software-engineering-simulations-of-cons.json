  "description": "SOLVCON is a collection of Python-based conservation-law solvers and\nuses the space-time Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE)\nmethod. SOLVCON targets at providing a reusable code base for systems of\nfirst-order, linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs).\nIn addition to numerical methods, modern conservation-law simulations\nrequire code for parallel computing and flexible input, output, and work\nflow. Researchers spend a lot of time in these supportive\nfunctionalities, although they should have focused on the physical\nprocesses or numerical methods. Further, SOLVCON emphasizes the\nconnections among documenting, coding, and testing. Many Python-based\ntools are used in the development, e.g., Sphinx, NumPy, Cython, nose,\netc. SOLVCON is open-source and uses a BSD-style license.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nYung-Yu is a software developer for high-performance computing\napplications. His interests lie on numerical simulations of conservation\nlaws.\n",
