  "description": "Knowledge graph is the new search engine technology. All the leading\nsearch engine exploit knowledge graph to provide more accurate result to\nuser, e.g. Bing, Google, Yahoo.\n\nIn this talk, the speaker will demonstrate how to build a searchable\nknowledge graph from scratch. Lots of python tools will be applied\nduring the process. The process includes data wrangling, graph entity\nindexing, full text search and web visualization. The data sources are\nfrom dbpedia.org. Enormous amount of entities are collected and stored\nto graph database for relationship querying and full text search engine\nfor searching. In the web visualization, a searchable interface and\nvisualized result demonstrate the knowledgable information to customer.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJimmy Lai is a Python fan, and his interested topics are natural\nlanguage processing and machine learning. He specializes in combining\nmachine learning algorithm and cloud computing technology to do big data\nanalysis, building application services.\n",
