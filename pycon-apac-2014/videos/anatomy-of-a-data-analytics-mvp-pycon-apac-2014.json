With companies\nsuch as Salesforce spearheading the adaption of business SaaS products\nin corporate, startups are rising to take on the SME market.\n\nWith hot topics such as \"big data\" and \"machine learning\" flying around,\nit may seem overwhelming to put an idea into action. I will walk through\nthe process of building an data analytics minimum viable product (MVP).\nAttendees will have hands on experiences with the free and/or affordable\ntechnology and services that can get their MVP up and running.\n\nThis talk assumes attendees understand the basic of Python. Basic\nunderstanding of MapReduce and NoSQL databases will be big pluses as\nwell.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI am a data scientist, software developer, and aspiring entrepreneur.\nI'm especially interested in machine learning, information retrieval,\ntext analytics, and cloud technology. My weapon of choice is Python.\n\nI previously founded a social data analysis company and developed its\ncore technology. I grew the startup into a profitable entity, without\nany outside funding.\n",
