  "description": "Andreas Kl\u00f6ckner is an assistant professor in the scientific computing\ngroup within the Department of Computer Science at the University of\nIllinois at Urbana-Champaign. He works on high-order numerical methods\nfor the simulation of wave problems as well as issues in\nhigh-performance scientific computing that relate to bringing these\nmethods to life on large-scale parallel computers. In support of his\nresearch, Dr. Kl\u00f6ckner has released numerous software packages for\nscientific computing in Python, including PyOpenCL, PyCUDA and the PuDB\nPython debugger. He obtained his PhD degree at the Division of Applied\nMathematics at Brown University with Jan Hesthaven, working on\nlarge-scale finite element simulations of wave problems in the time\ndomain. From Brown, Kl\u00f6ckner moved to the Courant Institute of\nMathematical Sciences at New York University as a Courant Instructor,\nwhere he worked on integral equation methods and fast algorithms within\nLeslie Greengard's group.\n",
