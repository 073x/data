  "description": "As hackathons become more prevalent, one thing has (mostly) stayed the\nsame: the ratio of male to female hackathon participants is often lower\nthan the ratio in the broader computer science community.\n\nHow can hackathon organizers be mindful of this issue, and encourage a\ndiverse pool of participants? This talk will cover the basics of how to\nrun an inclusive hackathon, as well as successful strategies organizers\nhave used in the past. We will examine case studies of several of the\nlargest college hackathons.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI am a software engineer at MongoDB. Previously, I graduated from the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, where I was a lead organizer for the\nPennApps Hackathon and very involved in the college hackathon community.\n",
