  "description": "We can never rely on network firewall to be secure. We also must have a\nsecure application. Besides test the functionality of the application,\nwe must also test the security of the application. While the latter is\nfrequently not performed hence the first is considered more important.\n\nIn this 25 minute talk, I'll share my experience using python for\napplication security testing: from SQL injection, brute force attack,\nidentifying and cracking password hashes, to proxy-ing the network\ntraffic: intercept and modify it; and also doing network forensic.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\n| Just another Python enthusiasts\n| Mainly use Python for application security testing\n| Planet Python Indonesia maintainer\n| Python Indonesia meetup organizer\n",
