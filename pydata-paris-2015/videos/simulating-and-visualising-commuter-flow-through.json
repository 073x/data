  "description": "Every year the London Tube transports about 1.3 billion commuters. With\nmultiple intersecting lines, the daily functioning of the London Tube\nnetwork poses many interesting questions: What effects do severe delays\non the Piccadilly Line have on passengers taking the Northern Line? What\nis the shortest path from station x to station y? How does overcrowding\non one station affect its neighbouring stations? These are but a few\nexamples of the many questions one can start to investigate using two\nPython libraries: graph\u00adtool for manipulating and analysing graphs and\nbokeh for visualizing and streaming \u201clive\u201d data from simulations. In\nthis talk, I will briefly show how one can transform structures such as\nthe London Underground map into programmatic objects that can be\nanalysed and manipulated using Python. Furthermore, I will show examples\nof simulations based on the publicly available data from Transport for\nLondon and illustrate how simulations can be used to glean insight on\nthe large scale behaviour of a complex system. Last but not least, I\nhope to illustrate how the bokeh server can be leveraged to create\n\u201creal\u00adtime\u201d visualizations of simulations.\n",
