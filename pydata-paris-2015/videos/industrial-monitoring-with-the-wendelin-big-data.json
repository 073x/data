  "description": "This talk presents the Wendelin Big Data \u201cFull Stack\u201d and introduces a\nfirst success story related to the collection of vibration data in wind\nturbines and the analysis of vibrations.\n\nWendelin (http://wendelin.io/) combines automated cluster deployment,\ndistributed data persistency for NumPy arrays, parallel data processing,\nfluentd compliant data ingestion interface and JIO compliant javascript\ninterface. It is an all\u00adin\u00adone open source solution that provides a 100%\nnative python alternative to hybrid solutions based on Spark.\n\nThe talk is derived from the presentation made at MariaDB community\nevent (https://mariadb.org/en/community-events/). The presentation of\nWendelin Full Stack will be shorter than in Santa Clara in order to\nprovide enough time to present the first implementation for Wind\nTurbines. We will show in particular which parts of data analysis are\nhandled on server side with pydata libraries, which parts of data\nanalysis are handled on browser side in javascript and how both can be\nintegrated to minimize implementation costs.\n\nThe talk concludes on Wendelin platform roadmap.\n",
