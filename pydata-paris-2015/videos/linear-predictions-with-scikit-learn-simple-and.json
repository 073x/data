  "description": "Scikit-Learn offers numerous state-of-the-art models for prediction\n(regression and classification). Linear models (e.g. Ridge, Logistic\nRegression) are the simplest of these models. They have pratical\nbenefits such as interpretability and limited computation time while\noffering the best performance for some applications. This talk will\ncover the basics of these models with examples and demonstrate how they\ncan scale to datasets that do not fit in memory or how they can\nincorporate simple polynomial non-linearities.\n",
