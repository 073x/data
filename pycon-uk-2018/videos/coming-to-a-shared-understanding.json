  "description": "Or, how I learned to stop assuming and love communication\nSean Sabbage\n\nSunday 16th, 15:00 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nWhenever multiple people are working on the same thing, there is a need to communicate. But how can you be sure that the thing that you're thinking about is the same thing that everyone is is thinking about? Are you sure that your idea of a web page with a simple form on it is the same as your colleague's idea of a web page with a simple form on it?\n\nYour team needs a shared understanding, and this talk aims to explore what that means, why it's important, and equip attendees with some tools to help them reach it.",
