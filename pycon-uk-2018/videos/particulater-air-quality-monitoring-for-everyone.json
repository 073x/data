  "description": "A citizen data science project for monitoring an individuals exposure to pollutants\n\nOliver Crask\n\nMonday 17th, 12:00 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nAir pollution is getting worse across the world, but how does an individual know how to reduce their exposure?\n\nI will be presenting my project that is focused on personalised air quality monitoring. The battery-powered device measures air pollution, as well as a series of other environmental variables. The data is then transmitted wirelessly to my Home Assistant instance. This allows a user to monitor, visualise and ultimately predict their daily exposure to pollutants. In addition the Home Assistant integration makes it simple to trigger actions based on their data. For example, flash a light in a user\u2019s home or send them a notification, if the pollutant concentration rises. All that you need to make your own is a low cost micro-controller and a few readily available components.",
