  "description": "Two Pythonistas, one city break, one challenge: re-create a train announcement board on a RaspberryPi-powered LCD\n\nHenry Morris, Dale Potter\n\nSaturday 15th, 14:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nThis talk will tell our story \u2013 two friends who were curious what trains were going past one of their houses every five minutes.\n\nRather than buy an over-priced Windows-powered monstrosity(!), we'll explain how we built an open-source train announcement board using an LCD display, powered by a RaspberryPi. We'll run through how we started with way too grand a plan, how we de-scoped the project and how we built it over the course of a weekend city break. Naturally, the talk will end with a demo!\n\nAttendees should come to learn what it takes to scrape train data and present it on a RaspberryPi LCD but stay to hear about coding city breaks!\n\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.",
