  "description": "Readability and Maintainability are Boring\nMac Chapman\n\nSaturday 15th, 15:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nIn my time, I\u2019ve written some really exciting code: I\u2019ve overridden nearly every operator in python and I've written logic in XML. It was a lot of fun, but it was all impossible to maintain. In this session I\u2019ll work through some beginner to intermediate techniques for making code more predictable and manageable and share a few stories from projects past. I\u2019ll tell you why you shouldn\u2019t make a CSS class called \u201cyellow\u201d, what a variable called \u201cnoecho\u201d really ought to do, and why you probably don\u2019t need a variable called \u201cnoecho\u201d anyway.",
