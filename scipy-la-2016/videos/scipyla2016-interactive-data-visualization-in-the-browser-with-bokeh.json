  "description": "Palestrante: Bryan Van de Ven\n\nResumo:\n\nWith support from the DARPA XDATA Initiative, commercial engagements, and contributions from over 150 community members, the Bokeh visualization library (http://bokeh.pydata.org) has grown into a large, successful open source project with heavy interest and following on GitHub (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh). The principal goals of Bokeh are to provide capability to developers and domain experts: easily create and share interactive, versatile, and powerful visualizations that extract insight from data sets that may be remote, large, or streaming. Bokeh provides a compelling open-source visualization platform for scientists who want to create interactive data applications in the browser for themselves, their colleagues, or for a wider audience, recently evidenced by the first instances of interactive Bokeh visualizations appearing in published journal articles.\n\nThis talk will give a quick overview of recent developments, and demonstrate some of the newest capabilities of Bokeh including:\n\n* Bokeh applications and the second generation Bokeh server (that is more performant, better documented, and much simpler to use and deploy)\n\n* APIs for streaming data (both in the notebook and Bokeh applications)\n\n* The ability to extend Bokeh with your own custom functionality (for example to create 3D plots or network graphs)\n\n* Recent GIS features such as support for GeoJSON and tiled map data sources\n\nFinally the session will conclude with a brief demonstration using the new Datashader library can be used together with Bokeh to visualize billions of data points.",
