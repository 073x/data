  "description": "Palestrante: Eduardo Silva\n\nResumo:\n\nThe idea in this talk is show how python can be used to solve Linear/Integer Programming Problems.  The main tool presented will be PuLP (https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/), an open-source Python-based COIN-OR modelling language developed by Stu Mitchell, and the basic steps to build and solve those models with python will be addressed.\nIn addition, another interesting tool will be presented, SolverStudio (SolverStudio.org), developed by Andrew Mason from University of Auckland, New Zealand, which is an add-in for Excel 2007 and later on Windows that allows you to build and solve optimization models in Excel using any other Python software that runs under either IronPython or standard Python (i.e \u2018CPython\u2018).",
