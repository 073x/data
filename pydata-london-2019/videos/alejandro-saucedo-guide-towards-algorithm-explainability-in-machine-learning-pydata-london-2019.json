  "description": "A practical guide towards algorithmic bias and explainability in machine learning.\n\nSlides and code - https://github.com/EthicalML/explainability-and-bias/\n\nUndesired bias in machine learning has become a worrying topic due to the numerous high profile incidents. In this talk we demystify machine learning bias through a hands-on example. We'll be tasked to automate the loan approval process for a company, and introduce key tools and techniques from latest research that allow us to assess and mitigate undesired bias in our machine learning models.",
