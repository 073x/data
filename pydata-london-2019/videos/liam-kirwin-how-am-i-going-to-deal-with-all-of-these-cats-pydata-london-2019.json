  "description": "Machine learning models prefer numbers to words, but categorical fields are everywhere in real-world datasets. It's both a blessing and a curse that there are countless ways of handling them. This talk will be super-practical: I'll provide a broad view of the different approaches at your disposal, and give you some ideas about which to try in different situations.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
