  "description": "Reinforcement learning has enjoyed its recent prominence with its combination with the class of rich function approximators known as deep neural networks. The combination, referred as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have demonstrated to perform on complex tasks from Atari games to robotics to self-driving cars. This tutorial dives into how to frame and solve DRL problem with python.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
