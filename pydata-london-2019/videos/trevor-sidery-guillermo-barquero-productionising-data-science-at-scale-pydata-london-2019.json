  "description": "Operations at Tesco have historically been quite manual with varying amounts of analytical knowhow applied. As data science and big data technology becomes more embedded into the way we work, this is shifting to centralised solutions at scale. This presents challenges, but also large benefits for producing national, and even international level solutions. We present a couple of examples of how we implement large scale solutions that are now embedded into the operations of Tesco.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
