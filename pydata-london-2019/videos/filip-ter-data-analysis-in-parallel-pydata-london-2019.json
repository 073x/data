  "description": "Slides - https://github.com/terfilip/DataAnalysisParallel-PyData/blob/master/PyData%20Slides%20-%20FT.pdf\n\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to efficiently use IPyParallel, to benefit from parallelism in the early stages of data analysis and model development. The aim is to demystify parallelism for analysts and researchers, so that they can start using it early on in their workflow. Examples of common tasks will be shown in Jupyter, and how they can be easily run in parallel without major disruption.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
