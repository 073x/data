  "description": "Weak supervision: a new paradigm for unreliable labels\nEddie Bell\n\nDescription\nMachine learning is easier when you have access to a large number of quality labels. Unfortunately acquiring labels is expensive or impossible in many domains. Recently, the new paradigm of weak-supervision has emerged in which a set of weak and cheap labelling sources are mapped to high-quality labels. In this presentation, I'll describe the methods and research underpinning weak-supervision.",
