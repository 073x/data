  "description": "Weak supervision: a new paradigm for unreliable labels\nEddie Bell\n\nDescription\nMachine learning is easier when you have access to a large number of quality labels. Unfortunately acquiring labels is expensive or impossible in many domains. Recently, the new paradigm of weak-supervision has emerged in which a set of weak and cheap labelling sources are mapped to high-quality labels. In this presentation, I'll describe the methods and research underpinning weak-supervision.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
