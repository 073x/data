  "description": "Classic recommender systems are great for answering the question \u201cwhat does a user want in general?\u201d. However, they only get you partway to an answer to \u201cwhat does a user want right now?\u201d. To close the gap, it helps to capture and act on real-time user intent. I\u2019ll share examples of this paradigm, and the resulting changes to our algorithms and architectures.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
