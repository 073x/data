  "description": "Discretionary investment managers are using an increasing number of quantitative techniques and technologies to enrich their fundamental decision making process with the vast amount of data that is available nowadays. In this talk, I will outline the motivation behind such \"quantamental\" investment approaches (where fundamental and quantitative meet), how we at Man Group think about this topic, and the lessons learned on how to implement \"quantamental\" efficiently.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
