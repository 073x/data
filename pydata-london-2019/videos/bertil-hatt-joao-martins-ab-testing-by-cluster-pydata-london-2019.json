Say to test an over-the-line (OTL) ad campaign in different cities, or on partners, or on your customer support team that has \u201conly\u201d hundreds of member? AB-test by cluster, simulate the sensitivity of your test\u2014and impress your stakeholders!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
