  "description": "Gradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of practical tasks. This tutorial will explain details of using gradient boosting on practice, we will solve a classification problem using popular GBDT library CatBoost.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
