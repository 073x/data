  "description": "The journey to deploy a model to production starts with testing it rigorously, including its code implementation. In this tutorial, you will learn about state of the art software testing approach. You will learn how to write unit tests with enhanced diagnostics, leverage validation tools from numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, apply test doubles and generate test cases using property-based testing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
