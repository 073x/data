  "description": "Christopher Samiullah, Soledad Galli: Testing and Validating Machine Learning Models when Deploying to Production | PyData London 2019\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/solegalli2013/2019-london-pydata-testing-and-monitoring-of-ml-models\n\nThrough model deployment, we bridge the gap between the research environment and live systems. Reproducibility between environments is key to maximise the researched value the ML models will bring to an organisation. Therefore, before the models are fully integrated and live, we run thorough testing and reconciliation processes.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
