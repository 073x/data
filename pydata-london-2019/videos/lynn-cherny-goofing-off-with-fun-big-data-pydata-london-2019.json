  "description": "Goofing Off with Fun (Big) Data\nLynn Cherny\n\nSlides - https://ghostweather.slides.com/lynncherny/getting-your-data-joie-de-vivre-back\n\nDescription\nMost of us work too much and play too little. When was the last time you smiled at something you made? Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation. I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
