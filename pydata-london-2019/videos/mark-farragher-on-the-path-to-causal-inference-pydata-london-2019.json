  "description": "On the Path to Causal Inference\nMark Farragher\n\nDescription\nThere has been a boom in the application of machine learning to solve business problems involving big data, but very few data scientists and statisticians are familiar with methods of causal inference. This talk is a primer on causal inference: what is it, why is it important and how can we apply it to projects?\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
