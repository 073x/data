  "description": "Tom Stordy-Allison\n\nEnaml is an open source library for building rich user interfaces utilizing a declarative extension to the Python language grammar. The Enaml DSL is a strict superset of Python allowing developers to declaratively define dynamic user interface hierarchies. Notable features of the framework include: automatic data binding dependency analysis, a cassowary constraint based layout system, and support for multiple model change notification systems (and asynchronous bindings).\n\nEnaml has been used for building production Python applications at J.P. Morgan for several years. This talk will provide a brief introduction to the language, cover some of the notable features, and also look at some of the features that J.P. Morgan have been adding to the language.",
