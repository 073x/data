  "description": "Gail Ollis\n\nSoftware development is not easy.\n\nAs grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be achieved by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new idea, that new tool, will make all the difference.\n\nMeanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I invite you to join me in a more constructive realm between belief and cynicism, where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open mind, but not be bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.",
