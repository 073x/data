  "description": "Where am I? What am I doing here?\" -- Motion detection and sensor fusion on wearables and Micro:Bit with Python\n\nStephen Simmons\n\nAccelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers are suddenly everywhere -- in phones, wearables, and even in the BBC micro:bit. They are cheap, ultra-low power, and often can be read remotely using Bluetooth Low Energy. In this talk, learn how Python can help you: \n\n- collect raw multi-axis data in real time; \n- combine them optimally into a useful representation for analysis; \n- deal with noisy and missing data with Kalman filters; and \n- extract high-level gesture information. \n\nThe talk will include examples using MetaWear CPRO wearables and the BBC micro:bit",
