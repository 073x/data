In lieu of the usual NumPy and SciPy one can instead make use of mpmath or SymPy. For a 'large-scale' calculation one must appeal to parallelism and indeed distributed resources (eg. Dask-distributed). We describe a package that provides for library delegation based on calculation requirements at runtime.",
