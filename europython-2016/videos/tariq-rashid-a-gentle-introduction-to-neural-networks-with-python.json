If you are more technically capable, you will see how you could make your own with Python and numpy.\n\n-----\n\nPart 1 - Ideas:\n\n- The search for AI, hard problems for computers easy for humans\n- Learning from examples (simple classifier)\n- Biologically inspired neurons and networks\n- Training a neural network - the back propagation breakthrough\n- Matrix ways of working (good for computers)\n\nPart 2 - Python:\n\n- Python is easy, and everywhere\n- Python notebooks\n- The MNIST data set\n- A very simple neural network class\n- Focus on concise and efficient matrix calculations with bumpy\n- 97.5% accuracy recognising handwritten numbers - with just a few lines of code!\n\nPart 3\n\n- Q&A",
