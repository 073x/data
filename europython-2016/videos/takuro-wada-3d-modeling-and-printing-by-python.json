But recently, so many 3D software\n(like Maya,  Blender, Fusion360 and so on) provides Python API to\nmanipulate 3D data in those software. So in this session,  I will\nintroduce Python API of Blender  and Autodesk Fusion 360 and share\nsome basic knowledge and tips when you use these API. I will also\nintroduce my past projects with those APIs.\n\n-----\n\nAbstract\n--------------------\n\n- Creating 3D model for 3D printing is pretty hard for **non 3D CG designer or non 3D CAD engineer**.\n\n- Recently, so many 3D software (like Maya,  Blender, Fusion360 and so on) provides Python API to manipulate 3D data in those software. Once you learn these Python API, you can generate 3D model by Python  and 3D print those generated model.\n\n- In this session,  I will introduce Python API of some softwares and share some basic knowledges and tips when you use these API. I will also introduce my past projects with those APIs and my products.\n\n\n\nGoal\n--------------------\n- Introduce 3D model generation and 3D printing with Python to audience\n\nAfter this session, you will\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n- Acquire the basic knowledge of 3D data structure\n- Understand basic concepts of Python API provided by 3D softwares\n- Acquire knowledge to start your 3D model generation project by Python\n- Know past 3D model generation projects by Python\n\nPrerequisite\n--------------------\n\n- Basic knowledge of Python\n- Interests for 3D modeling and 3D printing by Python\n\n[1]: http://takuro.ws/img/euro_python.jpg",
