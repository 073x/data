In the talk we will focus on\ntranscribing a monophonic audio input and see how we can modify it on\nthe fly. To achieve that, we need to determine pitch and duration of\neach note, and then use these parameters to create a sequence of MIDI\nevents.\n\n-----\n\nMusic transcription allows to convert an audio recording to musical\nnotation through mathematical analysis. It is a very complex problem,\nespecially for polyphonic music - currently existing solutions yield\nresults with approx. 70% or less accuracy.\n\nIn the talk we will focus on transcribing a monophonic audio input and\nsee how we can modify it on the fly.\nTo achieve that, we need to determine pitch and duration of each note,\nand then use these parameters to create a sequence of MIDI events.\nMIDI stands for *Musical Instrument Digital Interface* and it encodes\ncommands used to generate sounds by musical hardware or software.\n\nLet's see how to play around with sounds using Python and a handful of\nits powerful libraries. And let's do it in real-time!",
