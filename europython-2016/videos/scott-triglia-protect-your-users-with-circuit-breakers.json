Lucky for us, there are techniques that\ncan help protect your product and handle failures in subsystems\ngracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the\nCircuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for\nkeeping all our users safe. We will be focusing on several real-world\nproblems and options for how to implement your circuit breaker setup\nin nice, readable python code.\n\n-----\n\nThe inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web\nservice and can cause serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there\nare techniques that can help protect your product handle failures in\nsubsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth,\nthe Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for\nkeeping our users safe.\n\nWe will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be\naddressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk\nwith details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how\nthey can be adapted for more complex situations. We\u2019ll also discuss\nsome options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable\npython.\n\n\n**Contrived FAQ time!**\n\n**I don\u2019t know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**\nDefinitely! We\u2019re going to start from scratch and work our way up.\nOnly requirement is basic familiarity with backend services receiving\nand making HTTP requests.\n\n**I totally know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**\nDefinitely! After the intro, the main meat of the talk will be working\nthrough a series of more advanced situations and talking about how we\ncan alter the basic circuit breaker setup to address them.\n\n**I want real-world advice, not made up hypotheticals!**\nWell that\u2019s not really a question, but you\u2019ll be happy to know that\nthe examples we\u2019ll discuss come straight from my experience at Yelp.\nThey should be very realistic and broadly applicable.",
