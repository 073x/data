Ansible is an\namazing tool which allows us to free more time for music by automating\nboring and repetitive tasks, and to contribute back to the open-source\ncommunity with ease. Here's an opportunity to share our love for it,\nour experience with it, and our contributions to it with you.\n\n-----\n\nComputers are never as convenient as when they work for us. If you\nagree with this motto, then Ansible, a deployment and automation tool\nwritten in Python, might come in handy.\n\nAt Ableton, Ansible is involved in every aspect of deployment and\nautomation. From local machine setup, to vm creation and deployment in\nour self-hosted datacenter, to our services in the immensity of the\ncloud.\n\nBecause it is dead simple to use, can deal with any number of hosts in\nparallel and has robust compatibility with Unix as well as Windows\nsystems, you will probably never have to write a shell script again.\n\nBecause it is written in Python and exposes a clean, extensible and\neasy to adapt design and architecture; contributing features to the\nproject and fixing the bugs you might encounter during the journey is\nextremely easy.\n\nAt Ableton we love music and we love open-source. Ansible is an\namazing tool which allows us to free more time for music by automating\nboring and repetitive tasks, and to contribute back to the open-source\ncommunity with ease.
