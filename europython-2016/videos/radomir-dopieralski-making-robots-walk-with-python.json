During this\ntalk you will see different ways in which such a robot can be\ncontrolled in Python, either by using remote control, with the Python\nprogram running on a stationary computer, by putting a small computer,\nsuch as a Raspberry Pi on it, or by programming it with Micropython, a\nversion of the Python language designed for microcontrollers. I will\nalso explain the basic problems with walking robots and how Python can\nbe used to overcome them. Finally, I will show some of the robots I\nhave built.",
