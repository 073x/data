Python is a\nvery powerful language for data analysis. What happens if we combine\nthe two? We get a very versatile and robust system for analyzing data\nat small and large scale!\n\nI will show how we can make use of Python and Docker to build\nrepeatable, robust data analysis workflows that can be used in many\ndifferent contexts. I will explain the core ideas behind Docker and\nshow how they can be useful in data analysis. I will then discuss an\nopen-source Python library (Rouster) which uses the Python Docker-API\nto analyze data in containers and show several interesting use cases\n(possibly even a live-demo).\n\nOutline:\n\n1. Why data analysis can be frustrating: Managing software, dependencies, data versions, workflows\n2. How Docker can help us to make data analysis easier & more reproducible\n3. Introducing Rouster: Building data analysis workflows with Python and Docker\n4. Examples of data analysis workflows: Business Intelligence, Scientific Data Analysis, Interactive Exploration of Data\n5. Future Directions & Outlook",
