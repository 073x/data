As\nwell as being key to the quality of the code itself, it has helped\ndrive the development of Django as a community project, and even the\nprofessional development of programmers who adopt Django.\n\nI'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can\neasily win the same benefits.\n\n-----\n\nPart of my job title is *Documentation Manager*. When I explain this\nto a programmer outside the Python/Django community, the reaction can\nbe anything from bewilderment to a kind of mild horror. When I mention\nit to a Python/Django programmer, the response is usually: *Oh, cool*.\nIn fact, one secret of Django's success is the quality of its\ndocumentation, and everyone who uses Django is quick to note this.\n\nThe returns on Django's investment have been substantial, but some of\nthem are also surprising.\nThe documentation has clearly been key to the *quality of the code\nitself*, but also (less obviously) to the *development of Django as a\ncommunity project*, and even the *professional development of\nprogrammers* who adopt Django.\n\nI'll discuss how Django has achieved it, and how any project can\neasily win the same benefits.",
