If we\ndo the same for our code it is easier for others to re-use our hard\nwork, and maybe even contribute. We will take a quick look on how to\ndo this using popular tools and only a small investment of time. With\nGithub and some simple tools, setting up a well-groomed package\ndoesn't have to be difficult.\n\n-----\n\nEvery Python open-source developer wants their software to be used. As\ndevelopers, we trust software that is tested and well-documented.\n\nIn this talk we'll go through 5 steps for how to do this for your own packages.\n\nWe will take a quick look on how to do this using popular tools and\nsmall investment of time:\n\n- Write a setup.py script for a pure Python package\n- Set up py.test, tox and coverage to test our package with multiple versions of Python\n- Configure Github to use Travis CI & coveralls.io to automatically test our package every time we commit\n- Register and publish our package to PyPI\n- Setup our documentation on ReadTheDocs",
