This talk will dive\ninto SQLAlchemy beyond the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) parts and conentrate\non the SQLAlchemy Core API and the Expression Language:\n\n- **Database Abstraction**: Statements are generated properly for different database vendor and type without you having to think about it.\n\n- **Security**: Database input is escaped and sanitized prior to beeing commited to the database. This prevents against common SQL injection attacks.\n\n- **Composability and Reuse**: Common building blocks of queries are expressed as SQLAlchemy selectables and can be reuesd in other queries.\n\n- **Testability**: SQLAlchemy allows you to perform functional tests against a database or mock out queries and connections.\n\n- **Reflection**: Reflection is a technique that allows you to generate a SQLAlchemy repesentation from an existing database. You can reflect tables, views, indexes, and foreign keys.\n\nAs a result of the usage of SQLAlchemy in Blue Yonder, we have implemented and\nopen sourced a SQLAlchemy dialect for the in memory, column-oriented database\nsystem EXASolution_\n\n.. _EXASolution: https://github.com/blue-yonder/sqlalchemy_exasol\n.. _Blue Yonder: http://blue-yonder.com\n",
