The\ntalk will cover the hardware and modules, discuss briefly the\nalternatives, and finally show a live demo.\n\n-----\n\nThe robot uses two main modules:\n\n- **OpenCV** (*Open Source Computer Vision Library*), an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.\n\n- **gpiozero**, a simple interface to everyday GPIO components used with Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe first is used to recognize the people and the object; the second\nto control the robot.",
