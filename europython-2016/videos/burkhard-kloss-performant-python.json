In a lot of situations\nthat does not matter.  Sometimes it really does.  This talk will\nintroduce you to some tools and techniques for making sure your Python\ncode becomes fast enough \u2013 without turning into a maintenance\nnightmare.  Fast code does not have to be unreadable - and when you're\nwriting Python, it really pays of to think \"pythonically\".\n\nThat does mean using the included batteries, and utilising the\necosystem of tools around the language, too.\n\nWarning: may contain small bits of other languages.",
