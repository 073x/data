The data was\nnot always clean but we had some extra tools at hand and a complex\nsystem to make good guesses. Nevertheless it was hard to decide when\nto give up, some records were just not processable.\nFinally we used Game theory to make the decision.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory",
