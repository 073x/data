  "summary": "With various architecture decisions like Microservices, Restful APIs, MVC, and many more being widely discussed, it's often difficult to determine what you need to build your application. However, these patterns and many other well designed architectures follow common best practices including low coupling, high cohesion, and strong interfaces. Understanding these underlying principals is key to making the best decisions for your use case.\n\nIn this discussion we will explore how highly decoupled systems with strong interface boundaries aid in the maintainability and velocity of a project, and how to build such a system using python.",
