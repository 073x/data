  "summary": "PyCon Canada 2015:\n\nTalk Description:\nThe Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source project that facilitates communication between robotic components such as motors, cameras, and other sensors, and computational nodes such as movement commands and pose estimation. However, acquiring and analysing data from ROS can be a little tricky. In this talk, I will go over a few examples of loading data from saved files and live ROS processes using Python with the pandas and Seaborn libraries.",
