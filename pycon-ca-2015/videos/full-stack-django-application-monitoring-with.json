Many people set up a Pingdom endpoint on their home page, and call it a day; however this doesn't guarantee that all of the back end systems required for a functioning site are actually working.\n\nThis talk will dive into how to use django-watchman to enhance your monitoring coverage. Topics include:\n\n* How to install and configure django-watchman\n* What monitoring checks it provides out of the box\n* How authentication works\n* The three ways to use django-watchman: API, dashboard, and management command\n* How to integrate django-watchman with automated tools like Pingdom\n* How to write your own custom django-watchman checks",
