  "description": "We are working on extracting attributes (brand, shape, color etc) from raw product descriptions. The text is short and noisy and highly contextual and the labelling of attributes for training ML models is costly. I discuss how we build a deep sequence CNN-BiLSTM-CRF model in Pytorch to extract attributes from noisy text with minimum labelling using an active learning approach. \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
