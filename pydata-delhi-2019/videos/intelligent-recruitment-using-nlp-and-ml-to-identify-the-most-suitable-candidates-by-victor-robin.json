  "description": "It is very common to get 100s of applicants for a role, which is becoming difficult for recruiters to shortlist the most relevant candidates. We present here a solution developed at dunnhumby that leverages Natural Language Processing to assist our recruitment team. By simply providing a reference resume, our tool helps identifying similar candidates, helping us focus on the right candidates.\n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
