  "description": "We\u2019ve all heard terms like Bayes error, perceptron learning theorem, the fundamental theorem of statistical learning, VC dimension, etc. This talk is about using the math-heavy fundamentals of machine learning to understand the very solvability of classification problems. By the end of the talk, you will get a clear picture of how these ideas can be practically applied to classification problems. \n\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
