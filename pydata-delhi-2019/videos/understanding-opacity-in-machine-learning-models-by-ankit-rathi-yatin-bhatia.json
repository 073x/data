  "description": "Opacity is one of the biggest challenges in machine learning/deep learning solutions in the real world. Any basic deep learning model can contain dozens of hidden layers and millions of neurons interacting with each other. Explaining the Deep Learning model solutions can be a bit challenging. Our proposal explain some Approaches that can help to make ML/DL models more interpretable. \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
