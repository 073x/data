  "description": "Transfer learning refers to the methods that leverage a trained model in one domain to achieve better results on tasks in a related domain i.e. we transfer the knowledge gained in one domain to a new domain. This talk is centred on recent developments in deep learning to facilitate transfer learning in NLP. We will discuss the transformer architecture and its extensions like GPT and BERT. \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
