  "description": "During disasters, it is extremely crucial that the right resources are received to the victims within time. Disaster relief NGO's revealed that there is often mismanagement and lack of coordination. Also, often identifying the right resources takes up a lot of crucial time. To aid this, we developed an algorithm that identifies locations from microblogs, up to 100x faster than SoTA StanfordNLP.\n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
