  "description": "This talk presents a systematic approach to improve model lifecycle management for machine learning models, using Python/DevOps tools and processes to enable self-served model development and deployment; a four-step workflow guides the developer/modeller to develop, automate, test and implement the model in a virtual environment in a production-ready manner. \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
