  "description": "Distributed/Parallel computing is at the heart of new technology. Every company, big or small want to make most of the technology available to them. One such niche technology is GPU computing. Here, I present to you a real-world application on how GPU can save computing efforts and reduce the computation time from 2 days to 20 seconds. Shared is a live application from Retail domain utilizing GPU. \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
