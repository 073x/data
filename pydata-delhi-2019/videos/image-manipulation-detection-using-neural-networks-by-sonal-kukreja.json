  "description": "In the present world of social networking, image manipulation is the easiest and the scariest job! This requires an utter need for efficient image manipulation detection techniques. Moving from the traditional image manipulation detection techniques to the present scenario, CNN can be the perfect deep learning model as the human visual cortex has the ability to detect tampered areas in an image! \n\nhttps://delhi.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. #PyDataDelhi2019 #PyData #DataScience",
