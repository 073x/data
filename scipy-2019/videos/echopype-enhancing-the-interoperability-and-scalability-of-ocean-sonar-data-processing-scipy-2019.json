  "description": "Instrumentation advancements in the last decade have produced a deluge of ocean sonar data. These data provide opportunities to study the marine ecosystems at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, to date, these data remain significantly under-utilized, mainly due to the lack of data interoperability and scalable analysis workflow. We address these challenges by developing an open-source Python package, echopype, which defines an interoperable netCDF file format and leverages the power of Xarray and Dask for explicit and efficient sonar data analysis in the Jupyter environment.\n\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
