  "description": "This tutorial will cover the newest and most successful methods of time series analysis. 1. Bayesian methods for time series 2. Adapting common machine learning methods for time series 3. Deep learning for time series These methods are producing state-of-the-art results in a variety of disciplines, and attendees will learn both the underlying concepts and the Python implementations and uses of these analytical approaches to generate forecasts and estimate uncertainty for a variety of scientific time series.\nTutorial information may be found at https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
