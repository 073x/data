  "description": "Submodular selection can be used to reduce a complex data set down to a representative subset. This subset can then be used to train machine learning models with high efficiency and resulting accuracy. In this talk we will introduce apricot, a Python package for submodular selection, and show examples of its usage.\n\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
