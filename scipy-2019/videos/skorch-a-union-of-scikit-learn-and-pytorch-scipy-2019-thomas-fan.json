  "description": "Skorch is a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch. skorch reduces the boilerplate needed to train a neural network by abstracting away the training loop and providing a callback API for common tasks such as recording metrics and model checkpointing. This talk is targeted to users familiar with the scikit-learn API and have had some exposure to neural networks.\n\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
