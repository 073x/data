  "description": "Hypothesis is a testing package that will search for counterexamples to your assertions \u2013 so you can write tests that provide a high-level description of your code or system, and let the computer attempt a Popperian falsification. If it fails, your code is (probably) OK\u2026 and if it succeeds you have a minimal input to debug. Come along and learn the principles of property-based testing, how to use Hypothesis, and how to use it to check scientific code \u2013 whether highly-polished or quick-and-dirty!\nSee tutorial materials here: https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
