  "description": "In the United States, support for gun control has been declining among all age groups since 1990; among young adults, support is substantially lower than among previous generations. Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), I perform age-period-cohort analysis to measure generational effects. In this talk, I demonstrate a computational approach to statistics that replaces mathematical analysis with random simulation. Using Python and libraries like NumPy and StatsModels, we can define basic operations \u2014 like resampling, filling missing values, modeling, and prediction \u2014 and assemble them into a data analysis pipeline.\n\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
