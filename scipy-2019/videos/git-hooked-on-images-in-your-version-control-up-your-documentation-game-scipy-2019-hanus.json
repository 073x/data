Tracking screenshots of changes to visual projects in version control (Git) makes review of past changes easier, speeds acclimation to a new web project, and increases our understanding of tools used for automated testing. Join me for a review of integrated screenshot methods currently in use (ie. Python\u2019s Pyppeteer) and explore how you can customize a system to integrate screenshots into your version control, lower your cognitive load, and support new contributors.\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
