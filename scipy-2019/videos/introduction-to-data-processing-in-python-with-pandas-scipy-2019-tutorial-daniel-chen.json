  "description": "This is a tutorial for beginners on using the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation. We will go from the basics of how to load and look at a dataset in pandas (python) for the first time, and begin the process of preparing data for analysis. The topics covered are: - Load and look at slices and views of data - Groupby aggregates to summarize data - Tidy and reshape data - Write functions and apply them to data - Plotting data using Seaborn - Encode dummy variables to prepare for analysis and model fit - Fitting a model using sklearn By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid foundation on working with datasets in Python. The last topic of encoding dummy variables segues into using other libraries, such as scikit-learn and statsmodels to fit models on your data.\n\nTutorial information may be found at https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
