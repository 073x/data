  "description": "Bayesian statistical methods are becoming more common, but there are not many resources to help beginners get started. People who know Python can use their programming skills to get a head start. In this tutorial, I introduce Bayesian methods using grid algorithms, which help develop understanding, and MCMC, which is a powerful algorithm for real-world problems.\n\nTutorial information may be found at https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
