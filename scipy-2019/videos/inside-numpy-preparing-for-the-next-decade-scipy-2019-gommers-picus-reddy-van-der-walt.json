We will draw some lessons from a first year of grant-funded activity, discuss key obstacles faced, attempt to quantify what we need to operate sustainably, and present a vision for the project and how we plan to realize it.\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
