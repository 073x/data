  "description": "Topological Data Analysis is a suite of tools designed to help you understand the structure of high dimensional data. Techniques of persistent homology and mapper have been growing in popularity and breadth of application. Scikit-TDA is a new library designed to provide usable implementations of these techniques for data scientists in both industry and academia. This talk will introduce the fundamental ideas of Topological Data Analysis and show how Scikit-TDA can be used for making sense of your data. This talk is intended for anyone with an interest in new approaches for understanding their data.\n\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
