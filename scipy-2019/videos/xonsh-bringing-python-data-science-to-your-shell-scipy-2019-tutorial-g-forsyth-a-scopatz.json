  "description": "Xonsh is an interactive, cross-platform Python/Unix Shell hybrid language that makes it easy to switch between Python operations and command line interfaces. While Python has a wealth of data science libraries and tools, there are still plenty of utilities that live outside of the scientific Python ecosystem. Xonsh provides a way of gluing ALL of your tools together. Additionally, as a shell, xonsh comes with batteries-included features that are important in a scientific context. If you are new to shells, want to use Python for *everything*, or just plain fed up with sh-lang syntax, this tutorial is for you!\nSee tutorial materials here: https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
