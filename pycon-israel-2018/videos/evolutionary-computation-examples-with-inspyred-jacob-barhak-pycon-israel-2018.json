  "description": "This is joined work with Aaron Garrett who wrote Inspyred.\n\nEvolutionary Computation (EC) allows solving very complex optimization problems and NP Hard problems with relatively simple formulation. The Inspyred python library provides proper tools to solve such problems in a generic way, it supports genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and other EC techniques. The talk will provide an overview of the library and will show examples of application of the library to complex problems such as population generation with constraints and fair matching of groups towards tournament creation.\n\nRelated Repositories: https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred https://github.com/Jacob-Barhak/MIST https://github.com/Jacob-Barhak/FairTournament",
