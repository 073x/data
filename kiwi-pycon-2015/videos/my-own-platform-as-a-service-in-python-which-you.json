  "description": "Over the last couple of years I have evolved my own Platform as a\nService (PaaS) for hosting Django apps, and you can run it too.\n\nI use Nginx, Circus, Chaussette, and Django, with some support from\nDjango-environ and deployment automation using Fabric. All of that\nexcept Nginx are written in Python. Systemd is a new init process\ncoming.\n\n-  Circus is a process and socket manager, and gives a nice way to scale\n   processes.\n-  Chaussette WSGI server works well with Circus, as Circus can pass the\n   socket to it.\n-  Django-environ it's a library that parses environment variables or\n   files with key-value pairs. Environment variables are used on some\n   PaaS, but the file support I find very useful.\n-  Fabric is a framework for writing system commands to be run on remote\n   hosts, and is great for automating system administration.\n-  Systemd is a new \"init\" process for Linux and offers some interesting\n   possibilities for hosting Python webapps.\n\n",
