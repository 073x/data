  "description": "This talk is an introduction to Wagtail, a content management system\nbuilt on the Python web framework, Django. Many content managers are not\ndesigned with web developers in mind, and choosing the right CMS for a\nproject, that does it's job well and assists with fast paced\ndevelopment, can be difficult. Everyone has a favourite out there. I'm\nnot sure if I can call Wagtail my favourite yet, however I have found it\nto be a very developer-friendly system. And after unknowingly working\nalongside a core contributor for some time, I hadn't realised what\nlittle recognition Wagtail has as a tool, even among Django developers.\nMy talk will thus discuss the pros and cons of the system, with a\ndemonstration to show how easy it is to get started with using it. I\nwill also touch on it's nature as an open-source platform and some of\nit's potential futures.\n",
