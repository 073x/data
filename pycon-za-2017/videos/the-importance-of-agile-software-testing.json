  "description": "Kudakwashe Siziva\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/46/\nFrom the beginning of time, the relationship between developers and software testers has always been that of 'Cat and Mouse'. This relationship has had its fair share of short comings which chiefly included unmet deadlines and lack of confidence when shipping software products. The talk is meant to introduce a better relationship between developers and testers by going over the importance of including testing in an Agile cycle.\n\nWe will look at different levels of testing E.g. Unit vs integration testing, how units work together. Knowing why we are writing each test - what are we trying to achieve when we write a test for a unit as that is a place that developers struggle and either write duplicate tests or not enough and changeability and confidence can suffer as a result.\n\nObjective is to build better agile software teams and ship clean python projects with confidence.",
