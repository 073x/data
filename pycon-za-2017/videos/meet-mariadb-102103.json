  "description": "Ian Gilfillan\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/11/\nMariaDB 10.2 is the current stable release, and MariaDB 10.3 the current development release. This talk introduces some of the new features that may be of interest to Python developers, in particular Window Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Window functions are similar to aggregate functions in that they perform calculations across a set of rows. Recursive CTEs are excellent for navigating a tree structure, or a route map, which regular SQL is poor at.\n\nBy making use of these features. more work can be passed on to the database layer, simplifying the code and improving performance.",
