  "description": "Toufeeq Ockards, Martin Slabber\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/55/\nIn 2012 the The SKA SA Control and Monitoring (CAM) gave a talk at PyConZA and it can be viewed at this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN5cMyZucKI) and more info at [PyConZA 2012 link](https://2012.za.pycon.org/speaker/27/detail.html). \n\n5 years later, Python is still used for Controlling and Monitoring of this world-class instrument, that is on its path to being the most sensitive radio telescope in the southern hemisphere. The 64 dish array completion is around the corner and we take a look back at the last 5 years and our time with Python.\n\nWho is your audience?  \n\\- The general audience. It should interest all the attendees.\n\nWhat will they get out of it?   \n\\- Insight into the use of Python in a Large Experimental Physics Control System.\n\nWhat will you cover?  \n\\- Overview (SKA vs MeerKAT vs KAT-7)   \n\\- Why SKA SA chose Python   \n\\- How and where Python is used at SKA SA.  \n\\- Description of the Control and Monitoring problem domain (what we monitor &amp; control, data volumes)  \n\\- Architecture of the CAM subsystem (KATcp, proxies, monitors)  \n\\- Some of the lessons learnt over the last 5 years using Python.  \n\\- Overview of Control interfaces   \n\\- Live demo   \n\\- astronomy images produced by MeerKAT",
