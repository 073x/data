  "description": "Antonio Cuni\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/73/\nTest Driven Development is a well known practice in software development. However, passing from knowing the principles of TDD to applying them in real world situations is not straightforward: the aim of this talk is to help the audience to fill the gap and apply TDD effectively in Python. The talk will include:\n\n  * a brief overview of most popular tools and libraries (e.g. unittest, pytest, nose, tox)\n  * useful design patterns\n  * common mistakes and how to avoid them\n  * some real life example taken from the projects the author has worked on in the past 15 years (including PyPy, pdb++, capnpy)\n\nThis talk is primarily aimed at beginners.",
