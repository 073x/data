  "description": "Jonatas Baldin\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/47/\nServerless is an architecture style where we don't have servers*, dealing just with third-party services. This means infinite scaling, less downtime and less maintenance. Of course this is not the answer for every problem, but it can be a good choice.\n\nTogether with this concept, there's Zappa, a framework that makes that easily to deploy Python WSGI applications with AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.\n\nIn this talk, we're going to discuss about the concept and the tool, deploying a web Python application with Zappa!\n\n  * Kidding: Serverless still has servers ;)",
