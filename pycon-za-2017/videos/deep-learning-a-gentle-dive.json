  "description": "Dries Cronje\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/68/\nDeep Learning has the ability to disrupt and to disrupt fast. There are tools and algorithms mature enough to add value in almost any industry and you do not need a Math Ph.D to learn Deep Learning.\n\nIn this talk, I will briefly paint a picture of the exciting world of Deep Learning and then explain Deep Learning concepts using Convolutional Neural Networks as a base.\n\nThe last part will be a live demo of a Convolutional Neural Network written in Python doing image classification.",
