  "description": "Joannah Nanjekye\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/56/\nAlthough Python 3 is considered the future of Python, Python 2.x will be maintained for several more years, alongside Python 3 which is not backwards compatible with many open source projects and some packages on PYPi still supporting python 2.x because the users of these projects still use python 2.x. \n\nThis talk explains clean ways to write code that will run on both Python 2.x and 3.x with examples of how to convert existing Python 2-compatible code to code that will run reliably on both Python 2.x and 3.x.\n\nDevelopers working on either small, medium, or large projects will appreciate the explanations, detailed examples, and clean techniques to help them extend support for both versions to their existing Python 2-compatible projects. \n\nThe talk will give insight into the content in the book [Python 2 and 3 Compatibility](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Compatibility-Python-Future-Joannah-Nanjekye/dp/1484229541) that will available in October but be released in paper backs in January 2018 by Apress.",
