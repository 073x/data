  "description": "Adam Jorgensen\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/19/\nRecently at OpenDNA we've been rebuilding one of our core internal applications from the ground-up. Early on we decided that we wanted to make the new system completely asynchronous, leveraging the ability of modern browsers to communicate with the server in a bi-directional fashion unconstrained by the usual flow of a RESTful application. \n\nThere are a number of ways to implement this kind of application in Python but only one of them (in our humble opinion) is really worth investing time in: Crossbar.io\n\nIn this talk I will cover the process of developing a purely asynchronous application using Crossbar from top to bottom, detailing everything from high-level design considerations to low-level code decisions to potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nThe aim: To convince you that your next application should be built using Crossbar!\n\nThis talk should be suitable for any audience but will be of particular interest to developers looking for a way to leverage WebSockets and/or WAMP to develop highly or even purely asynchronous applications.",
