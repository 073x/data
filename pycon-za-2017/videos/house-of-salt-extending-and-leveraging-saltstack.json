  "description": "Marco Slaviero, Max Mclaughlin\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/15/\nOnce upon a time, sysadmins had cute naming schemes for their boxen, and it was good. Suddenly, virtualisation! And the cute names withered as herds of servers were born. Infrastructure automation and management became a thing. Helper software was released (without which a nine person company could not hope to manage 400-odd servers.) And it was good again, until the edges showed. Then we started to build.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll discuss the challenges encountered in managing hundreds of servers delivering a single product on AWS. Relying on SaltStack for deployment, management and diagnostics, we\u2019ve automated away painful steps and reduced our attack surface. SaltStack handles configuration and package management well, but is capable of much more once you start to customise it.\n\nAlong the way we\u2019ll show examples of custom SaltStack modules, runners, and event handlers. We\u2019ll describe threats and show how SaltStack helps us limit their exposure and impact. We\u2019ll catalogue the lessons we\u2019ve faced in two years of running SaltStack in our production environment. \n\nWe won't rehash content from previous talks, and novice users will get to see how the tool can be stretched. If you\u2019re wanting to get more out of SaltStack than the builtin modules allow for, this talk is for you.",
