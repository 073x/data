  "description": "Jeremy Thurgood\nhttps://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/43/\nFew things strike more fear into the heart of a seasoned software developer than the words \"legacy code\". However, many of us spend a lot of time working on byzantine monstrosities inherited from contractors, third parties, or Bob who left the company three months ago. Over the past several years, I've sunk way more hours than I care to think about into making legacy codebases more malleable. I've picked up a few tricks and strategies along the way that make the process a little smoother and less painful, and I will be sharing them in this talk.",
