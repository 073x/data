  "summary": "STATE OF THE REAL-TIME WEB WITH DJANGO\n\nThursday 11:30 a.m.--12:15 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Novice\n\nDESCRIPTION In 2013, \"real-time\" is more than a buzzword: it's a reality\non the Web. Unfortunately, for users of Django, it's still a foreign\nworld that involves new concepts and new components, and it doesn't\nintegrate well with traditional infrastructure. What is the real-time\nweb? Why is it hard to support in Django? What are our options today?\nWhat can we expect in the future?\n\nABSTRACT This talk will start by describing the protocols supporting the\nreal-time web and showing a few use cases. Then it will explain how this\nnew paradigm performs and scales differently from the traditional\nrequest / response cycle and it will present some software components\nthat can help build a real-time architecture. Finally it will analyse\nwhat PEP 3156 could mean for Django.\n",
