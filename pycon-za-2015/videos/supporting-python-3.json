  "description": "The tools for supporting Python 2 & 3 in a single codebase have improved\nsignificantly from the early Python 3 days of just 2to3. Porting Python\n2 code to work with Python 2 & 3 without a constant 2to3 translation\nstep is not hard anymore, and leads to much easier-to-maintain ports.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss some of the suggested best practices for\nsupporting both Python 2 and Python 3. We will cover some of the tools\nfor detecting potential issues, such as pylint, the available options,\nsuch as six, futurize and modernize, to simplify the process of updating\nthe code and spend some time discussing what parts of porting still\nrequire care and attention, such as the text / binary data division.\n",
