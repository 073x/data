  "description": "The talk will be a introductory tutorial showing how to get an ANPR\n(Automated Number Plate Recognition) system, which was developed for\ncommunity security, up and running on your Raspberry Pi. This will\nprovide a comfortable starting point for any security-prone person to\nstart monitoring the vehicles entering and leaving their community.\n\nThe target audience for this tutorial will be attendees who are\ninterested in using single board computers (Raspberry Pi2) as a security\nmeasure in their community. The technical level of the tutorial will be\nsuitable for beginners / intermediate level.\n\nThe tutorial will consist of the following:\n\n-  Quick overview of project\n-  Installing OpenCV\n-  Installing ANPR framework\n-  Connecting the IP cameras\n-  Configuring the ANPR (training)\n-  Retrieving data\n\n",
