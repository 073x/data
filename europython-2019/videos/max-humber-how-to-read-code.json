  "description": "\"How to read (code)\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - MongoDB]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Max Humber\n\nWhen you learn a new language, like French or German or even English, you first learn how to read. Then you learn how to write. When you learn a new emprogramming/em language, you first learn how to write. And that\u2019s it. \n\nImagine that you were never formally taught how to read. And that you were told that you should just figure it out \u2026 by writing \u2026 a whole bunch. How would that even work? I don\u2019t think it would.\n\nIf you can\u2019t read. You can\u2019t write. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nDo you think that Shakespeare would be Shakespeare if he never read a single book in his entire life? No. Nothing is created in a vacuum. Good writers are good writers because they\u2019re good readers. \n\nJust as reading is an invaluable skill so to is reading code. It\u2019s a skill that\u2019s never formally taught. But it\u2019s a skill that is essential nonetheless. In this talk I\u2019ll show you how to effectively read code so that might write better code.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
