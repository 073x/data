Setting up all necessary Agile meetings and using buzz words is not enough for the team to be happy and successful while working in Agile environment.\nInspired by the \"\"Divine Comedy\"\" by Dante Alighieri, I decided to create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!\nThis talk is divided into three parts:\n1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.\n2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.\n3.
