Then this session is for you! \nWe will start by reviewing a simple Dockerfile to package a Python application and move to more complex examples which speed up the build process and reduce the size of the resulting Docker image for both development and production builds.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
