  "description": "\"The Story of Features Coming in Python 3.8 and Beyond\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Singapore]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Andrey Vlasovskikh\n\nWhat's coming in Python 3.8? You can learn it by yourself by reading an excellent document a href=\"\"https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html\"\"What's New in Python 3.8/a. I'm not going to retell this document. Instead I'll focus on things barely described there or not mentioned at all:\n\n\nWhy will the new features appear in Python 3.8 and what's the story behind them?\nWhat is being discussed and developed now, but won't appear in Python 3.8?\n\n\nI'll share the news I learned at PyCon 2019 from the talks and discussions with Python core developers. I'll mention the following topics:\n\n\nNew syntax: codex := expr/code, codef(..., /, ...)/code, codef'{expr=}'/code\nNew types: codeLiteral/code, codeFinal/code, codeTypedDict/code\nFuture features of typing and async/await\nNew approaches to optimizing Python: sub-interpreters, mypyc\n\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
