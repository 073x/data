  "description": "\"Code quality in Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Rados\u0142aw Ganczarek\n\nFour years ago I talked about code quality during EuroPython in Bilbao. A lot of things changed from that time. Firstly, most tools I presented were still developed and gained new features, but also new ones appeared I wanted to discuss with you. Secondly, Python changed, Python 3 has type hints on board and there is a new tool dedicated to checking the types. Thirdly - I changed. I'm more distanced form my zealous approach from four years ago. I got real and reasonable. That's why I wanted to talk about code quality tools in Python again.\nI'll talk about all the software that can make code review a bit simpler by pointing out possible errors, duplicates or unused code. I'll talk again about formatters and how can they be used in modern-time projects. And I'll talk about hobgoblins, if you know what I mean :)\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/",
