  "description": "The asyncio module with updated chainable coroutines introduced with\nPython 3.4 was a game-changer for I/O management and asynchronous web\ndevelopment in Python. Even web frameworks like Tornado that already had\nan own asynchronous IO-loop implementation, can now take advantage of\nthe subgenerator delegation syntax to provide a high degree of\nconcurrency and responsiveness while keeping the simplicity of\nsequential code. This talk will focus on the new way of writing\nasynchronous code with Python 3, explaining the concept of futures,\ncoroutines and ioloop. It will complete with a basic demo of running\nthis code on Tornado, comparing its syntax and performance with other\npopular web frameworks.\n\nIt is also possible to present this topic in a workshop format. Contact\nme for details.\n",
