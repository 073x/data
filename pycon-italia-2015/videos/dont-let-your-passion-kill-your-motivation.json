  "description": "If I would ask you to sit down and do some work right now (assuming\nyou\u2019re not doing it), how would you feel about it? Would you be\nmotivated enough to take off your laptop and start coding? Or would you\nrather do something else? Programming is more about other things than\njust coding. Great books - like The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler\n- have eloquently explained the different perspectives there are about\nwhat programming is and how you can take the most out of your skills.\nNonetheless, programming is even more than that. Programming is more\nthan just producing results and it\u2019s definitely more than just being\n\u201csmart\u201d. In fact, programming is probably more about how to keep\nprogramming than actually doing it. Likely, one of the things we,\ndevelopers, struggle the most with is motivation. Therefore, join me in\nthis talk while I share some of my motivational ups and downs and walk\nyou through some of the things that have worked for me along the way.\n",
