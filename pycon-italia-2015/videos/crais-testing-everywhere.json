  "description": "CRAIS acts as an Appium (1) broker, in order to spawn Appium servers as\nselenium grid nodes with specific capabilities using:\n\n-  USB hotplug Mechanism for locally-connected devices, where CRAIS\n   dinamically generate the node, registering itself to the hub,\n-  RPC invocation, where CRAIS spawns ad-hoc appium server instances.\n   The RPC method could be used to use remote android devices connected\n   to the server using a reverse-ssh tunnel.\n\nCRAIS is based on:\n\n-  ZODB object database for device storage (for both Hotplug & RPC),\n   ConfigObj for configuration management, Pyro4, a library that enables\n   to build applications in which objects can talk to each other over\n   the network,\n-  Cement as CLI framework.\n\nCRAIS is implemented in order to use the same Object Database in both\nRPC & Hotplug mode.\n\n(1) Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with\n    native, hybrid and mobile web apps, used in B! to integrate Android\n    / iOS testing in a QA automation infrastructure.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n1. Selenium GRID specifications\n2. Acceptance testing knowledge\n3. Python multithreading & subprocess32 modules usage\n\n",
