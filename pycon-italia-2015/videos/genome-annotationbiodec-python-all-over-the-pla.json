  "description": "The talk will briefly describe BioDec\u2019s genome annotation pipeline,\nwhich has been internally evolved for ten years to annotate mammalian,\nbacterial, and viral genomes at the protein level. Everything we built\nis coded in Python: the machine-learning annotation engine, the\nmiddleware and the data visualization interface. A software that would\nhave been extremely difficult to create, for a tiny shop as BioDec,\nwithout leveraging the language itself and projects such as BioPython,\nScipy, Plone, and Web2py. We will try to distill some of the lessons\nthat we learned from more than ten years of experience dealing with\nmachine-learning-intensive applications and large data sets with\nopen-source software and Python.\n",
