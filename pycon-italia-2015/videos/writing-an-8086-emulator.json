  "description": "An 8086 emulator written in Python is presented. The talk gives a brief\nintroduction to the 8086 architecture, the pitfalls on emulating it, and\nthe challenge to have a working model ready to be quickly ported in C\n(which is the final goal of the project). Some classes are presented\nthat try to \u201cmimic\u201d the C memory pointers handling, to make the port\neasier. A set of APIs is shown, which are exposed to the emulator\n\u201cconsumers\u201d (applications, drivers, or kernels). Finally, some words are\nspent about how testing is done and can be reused by the C version as\nwell.\n",
