  "description": "Python is a great language, but there are occasions where we need access\nto low level operations or connect with some database driver written in\nC or we need to overcome to some speed boottleneck in Python due to some\nlimitation in the language, like NumPy or Scikit-learn do, using\nextensions. With the FFI(Foreign function interface) we can connect\nPython with other languages like C, C++ and even Rust or Fortran. There\nare some alternatives to achieve this goal, Native Extensions, Ctypes\nand CFFI. We\u2019ll compare this three ways of extending Python and we\u2019ll\nstudy pros and cons of each approach.\n",
