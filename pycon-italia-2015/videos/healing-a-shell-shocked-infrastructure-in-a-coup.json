  "description": "In September 2014 a very severe vulnerabilty in bash was discovered,\naffecting any Linux system on Earth. For Internet-facing services it was\nnecessary to patch the servers as soon as possible: the time was running\nlow and our hero (me) was lying in a bad, due to a painful back-ache \u2026 a\ndisaster was looming \u2026 This is an account of how everything ended well,\ndue to an appropriate management of the server infrastructure. A lot of\nprocedures had already been automated with Fabric, and it was at the end\nvery easy - even if quite stressful - to update everything in a couple\nof hours (~150 hosts in various configurations / locations). The talk is\na real case, and its objective is to help people understanding the\nimportance of proper server automation and management. Basic Python\nknowledge will be enough to understand the presentation, all the\nrelevant information about Fabric will be explained during the talk.\n",
