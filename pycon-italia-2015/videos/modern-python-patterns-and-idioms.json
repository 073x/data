  "description": "Python itself has grown to encompass some classic idioms, such as\nDecorate-Sort-Undecorate, AKA DSU, begetting the widespread key=\nargument to most functions related to ordering \u2013 but not quite all of\nthem: heapq, for example, still mostly lacks key= \u2013 so, we also show\nwhat idioms to use with this and similar modules.\n\nLists have long been one of Python\u2019s strengths, and they\u2019re of course\nstill precious \u2013 but many kinds of specialized containers have emerged,\nand it\u2019s important to know how to choose among them, and when and how to\nroll your own. More important still, iterators have grown into\nprominence, and very often they\u2019ll be the best choice \u2013 and they come\nwith a large set of relevant patterns and idioms.\n\nThe tectonic shift that\u2019s taking us from classic to modern Python goes\neven deeper \u2013 even the dominance of good old duck typing is threatened!\nSpecifically, in many cases, we use, instead, goose typing \u2013 checking\nagainst an abstract base class \u2013 and, as type annotations slowly emerge,\nthey reinforce this general tendency.\n\nThese, and a miscellanea of smaller patterns and idioms (concerning I/O,\nbest uses of dicts and other specialized mappings, async operations,\ntesting, \u2026), are fast becoming indispensable parts of the Proficient\nPythonista\u2019s repertoire.\n",

  "summary": "As Python grows, the problem spaces we address keep shifting, and best\npractices for software development mature, so does the set of\nbest-of-breed patterns and idioms change: some classics fading, new\nstars emerging. This talk helps fill the gap between yesterday\u2019s good\nold Python, and tomorrow\u2019s glittering vistas.\n",
