  "description": "In the last years, the Python programming language has engaged a major\nrenovation, and Python 3.x is going to be the next generation reference\nof the language. However, despite the community strives to support the\nlanguage switch among pythonistas, Python 3 is not yet the real de-facto\nreference version of the language and Python 2.x is still on the go.\nMoreover, as for the scientific Python community, only few years ago\nmost of the scientific python packages only (or mainly) supported Python\n2. In this talk we will analyse how far the support to Python 3 extent\nto the Python scientific packages, emphasising what actually works and\nwhat doesn\u2019t. The general claim of this talk is that, from a technical\nperspective, Python 3 is a more mature language from many point of view\n(w.r.t. Python 2), and the scientific community is now able more than\never to switch to Python 3. However, so far, the switch has not been\ndone yet. Thus, some reflections on this \u201cparticular\u201d community of\npythonistas will conclude the talk in order to stimulate the discussion\nand derive together possible solutions and \u201cworkaround\u201d to support this\nchange.\n",
