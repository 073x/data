  "description": "Django was actively supported at an early stage of the Python runtime in\nApp Engine SDK through the notable django-nonrel framework, a fork of\nthe original project that adds support for NoSql databases. But starting\nfrom the App Engine SDK 1.6.2, released more than two years ago, you can\ninstead deploy Django\u2019s official releases and take advantages from the\nwhole stack of the framework. In less than half an hour we\u2019ll see how we\ncan easily deploy the latest version of Django on the Google Cloud\nPlatform, taking advantage of the tools and services provided by App\nEngine, Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.\n",
