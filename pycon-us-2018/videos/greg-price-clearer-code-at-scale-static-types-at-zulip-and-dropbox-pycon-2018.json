  "description": "Speaker: Greg Price\n\nPython now offers static types! Companies like Dropbox and Facebook, and open-source projects like Zulip, use static types (with [PEP 484](/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2Fdev%2Fpeps%2Fpep-0484%2F&v=0c46YHS3RY8&redir_token=MsG4Zn0M23WFp-ApnCbY2vm97E18MTUyNjUwODM5NUAxNTI2NDIxOTk1&event=video_description) and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)) to make Python more productive and fun to work with \u2014 in existing codebases from 40k lines to 4 million, in Python 2 and 3, and while preserving the conciseness and flexibility that make Python a great language in the first place. I\u2019ll describe how.\n\nReading and understanding code is a huge part of what we do as software developers. If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That's why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, [Facebook](/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.instagram.com%2Flet-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881&v=0c46YHS3RY8&redir_token=MsG4Zn0M23WFp-ApnCbY2vm97E18MTUyNjUwODM5NUAxNTI2NDIxOTk1&event=video_description), and [Zulip](/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.zulip.org%2F2016%2F10%2F13%2Fstatic-types-in-python-oh-mypy%2F&v=0c46YHS3RY8&redir_token=MsG4Zn0M23WFp-ApnCbY2vm97E18MTUyNjUwODM5NUAxNTI2NDIxOTk1&event=video_description) use them on part or all of their Python code.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll share lessons from Zulip\u2019s and Dropbox\u2019s experience \u2014 having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team \u2014 for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We\u2019ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project\u2019s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.",
