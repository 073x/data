  "description": "Speaker: Amit Saha\n\nSetting up application monitoring is often an afterthought, and in the speaker's opinion can be a bit overwhelming to get started with. What is a `metric`? What is a `gauge`? What is a `counter`? What's that `upper 90` metric you have up on your `dashboard`? And what *all* metrics should I monitor?\n\nThis talk aims to get you started on the monitoring journey in Python. In addition to clearing up some of the jargon, we will look at `statsd` and `prometheus` monitoring systems and how to integrate our applications with these.\n\nWithout the numbers, we are really flying blind!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides",
