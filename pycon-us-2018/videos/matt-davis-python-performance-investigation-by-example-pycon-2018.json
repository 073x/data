  "description": "Speaker: Matt Davis\n\nOccasionally we\u2019ll find that some bit of Python we\u2019ve written doesn\u2019t run as fast as we\u2019d like, what can we do? Performance bottlenecks aren\u2019t always intuitive or easy to spot by reading code so we need to collect data with [profiling](/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.python.org%2F3.6%2Flibrary%2Fprofile.html&v=yrRqNzJTBjk&redir_token=-e3i4CeXrdVUwynzqE2CzmwP_FZ8MTUyNjUwODQwN0AxNTI2NDIyMDA3&event=video_description). Once we\u2019ve identified the bottleneck we\u2019ll need to change our approach, but what options are faster than others?\n\nThis talk illustrates a Python performance investigation and improvements using an [Advent of Code](http://www.adventofcode.com/) programming challenge. I\u2019ll walk through starting from a slow (but correct) solution, look at profiling data to investigate _why_ it\u2019s slow, and explore multiple paths for improving performance, including more efficient algorithms and using third-party tools like [Cython](http://cython.org/). You\u2019ll leave this talk with a recipe for analyzing Python performance and information about some options for improved performance.",
