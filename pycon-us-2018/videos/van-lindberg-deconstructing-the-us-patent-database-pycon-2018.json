  "description": "Speaker: Van Lindberg\n\nIn 2011 I gave a talk about \"Killing Patents with Python\" - finding the right piece of prior art by using statistical natural language processing techniques on the US Patent Database. A number of unexpected benefits came out of that exploration, including the ability to describe large patent portfolios and businesses in a way that had not been done before.\n\nSince then, the state of the art has advanced - and so has the ability to do strange and wonderful things by applying the latest neural network-based analysis to the nine million patents and patent applications that people have submitted to the USPTO. Not only can we learn new things about what people have invented, we might just be able to get the computer to do a little \"inventing\" itself.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides",
