  "description": "Speaker: Scott Sanderson\n\nPython is one of the world's most popular programming languages for numerical\ncomputing. In areas of application like physical simulation, signal processing,\npredictive analytics, and more, engineers and data scientists increasingly use\nPython as their primary tool for working with numerical large-scale data.\n\nDespite this diversity of application domains, almost all numerical programming\nin Python builds upon a small foundation of libraries. In particular, the\n`numpy.ndarray` is the core data structure for the entire PyData ecosystem, and\nthe `numpy` library provides many of the foundational algorithms used to power\nmore domain-specific libraries.\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to numpy -- how it\nworks, how it's used, and what problems it aims to solve. In particular, we\nwill focus on building up students' mental model of how numpy works and how\n**idiomatic** usage of numpy allows us to implement algorithms much more\nefficiently than is possible in pure Python.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides",
