  "description": "Speaker: Miguel Grinberg\n\nWhat do AWS, GitHub, Travis CI, DockerHub, Google, Stripe, New Relic, and the rest of the myriad of services that make our developer life easier have in common?\nThey all give you secret keys to authenticate with. Did you ever commit one of these to source control by mistake? That happened to me more times than I'm willing to admit!\n\nIn this talk I'm going to go over the best practices to follow when when writing Python applications that prevent this type of accident.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides",
