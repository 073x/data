  "description": "Speaker: Emily Xie\n\nIn this workshop, we\u2019ll learn how to make visual art using Processing.py, the Python mode for a powerful visual language library called Processing.\n\nThis tutorial walks through Processing.py from the ground up\u2013\u2013from initial setup & foundational concepts, to the library's core functions, as well as its more advanced features. Topics covered include the coordinate system, shape primitives, lines, stroke, fill, color, mapping, events, and transforms. At the end, we'll break out of the tutorial format and give free reign for attendees to create, tinker, and experiment freely with the framework.\n\nYou\u2019ll walk away with an art piece of your own original design, as well as a newfound appreciation for Python as a medium for creative expression.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides",
