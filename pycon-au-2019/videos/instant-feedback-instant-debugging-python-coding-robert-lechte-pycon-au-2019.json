There's a future beyond the text-editor \u2192 console-run loop and this is a taste of it.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/instant-feedback-instant-debugging-python-coding\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 14:10:00 2019 at C3.3",
