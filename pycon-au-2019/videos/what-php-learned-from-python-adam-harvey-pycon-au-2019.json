An advantage PHP had was that Python had gone through a similar process with Python 3 seven years earlier. I'll discuss the lessons taken from the Python 2-3 transition, and how they were applied.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/what-php-learned-from-python\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 11:10:00 2019 at C3.3",
