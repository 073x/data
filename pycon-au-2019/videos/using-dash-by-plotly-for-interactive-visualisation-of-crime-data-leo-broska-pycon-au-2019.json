In this talk I discuss the framework basics, explore a sample site and describe its use for an enterprise application to graph crime statistics. I finish with clear pros and cons of the Dash framework from our perspective.\n\nSlides for the talk are at http://www.halloleo.net/talks/dash_for_crime\n- more resources at https://github.com/halloleo/dash_for_crime.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/using-dash-by-plotly-for-interactive-visualisation-of-crime-data\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 11:10:00 2019 at C3.6",
