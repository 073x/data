Deep Learning or not, GPUs can provide massive computation speed\nups but it's not a panacea as NVIDIA would have you believe. Understanding how\nGPUs work can tell us where we should and shouldn't use them.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/understanding-gpus\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 14:50:00 2019 at Cockle Bay",
