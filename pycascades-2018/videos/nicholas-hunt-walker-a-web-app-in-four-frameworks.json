  "description": "Speaker: Nicholas Hunt-Walker\n\nIn this talk we take a tour of some Python web frameworks through the lens of an API for the same web application: a simple To Do list. We'll see how the same problems are handled across Django, Flask, Pyramid, and Tornado, and why you might choose one over the rest.\n\nFrom: PyCascades 2018 in Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nRecorded by: Elaine at http://jollygoodrecordings.ca",
