  "description": "Speaker: Yusuke Tsutsumi\n\nTwo years ago, the largest python project at Zillow was a multi-headed hydra of testing complexity, with hundreds of test cases that took longer to maintain than the code itself. Now, we've done a complete 180. Come learn about the patterns we used on 1000 tests to make them a joy to maintain.\n\nFrom: PyCascades 2018 in Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nRecorded by: Elaine at http://jollygoodrecordings.ca",
