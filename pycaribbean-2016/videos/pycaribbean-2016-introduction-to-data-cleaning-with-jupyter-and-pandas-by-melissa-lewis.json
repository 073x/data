  "description": "In this talk I'd walk through what I think are the best features of Jupyter (like magic methods, multimedia, several options for markup language, built-in documentation) and the best features of Pandas (powerful I/O, intelligent treatment of datetime) and analyze a public dataset. In this way I'd demonstrate that, as is typical of Python efforts, this is an extraordinarily lucid and beginner-friendly way to do data analysis in an open, replicable way.\n\n\"I'll also make the notebook and dataset available in advance of the talk so people can follow along. \"\n\n- Melissa Lewi",
