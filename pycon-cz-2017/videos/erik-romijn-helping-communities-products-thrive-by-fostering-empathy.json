  "description": "Empathy is a fundamental part of human interaction. When we\ncommunicate by email or at conferences, or indirectly, when we create\nproducts, events, or do a talk. However, our understanding of other\npeople is full of error, and worse, bias. This can lead us to make\ncommunities and products that work poorly for people that are\ndifferent from ourselves, introduce confusion and misunderstanding,\nexclude people unintentionally, and sometimes even cause harm.\n\nHowever, our communities are an opportunity to learn as well. To\nembrace our diversity, and expand our understanding of other people\u2019s\nworlds. To gain understanding of other people\u2019s situations,\nexperiences and emotions, which can be dramatically different to\nours. And how we can use this to create both products and communities\nwhich work great not only for ourselves, but also those that we more\neasily forget about. As creators in tech we have such tremendous\npower to create change, but merely our best intentions will not be\nenough for that.\n\nThis talk will explore how and why we sometimes have such difficulty\nto understand others, and how others can have difficulty to\nunderstand us. We\u2019ll talk about why other people\u2019s experiences,\nemotion and perceptions can be so different. Both for the world as a\nwhole, but also with the speaker\u2019s personal experiences. Finally,\nwe\u2019ll cover specific ways for us to understand others better, and\nassociated pitfalls, to make our communities and products happy,\ninviting and supportive places.",
