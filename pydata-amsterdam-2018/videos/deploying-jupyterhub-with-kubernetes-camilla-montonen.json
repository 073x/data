  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nJupyterHub is a great way to provide a data analytics environment for a class, a research group or a team of data scientists. In this talk, we will go through JupyterHub: what it is and how it works and how to setup a production ready deployment on a cloud provider using Kubernetes as the underlying infrastructure.\n\nSlides: bit.ly/pydataamsterdam2018-jupyterhub\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
