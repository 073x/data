  "description": "In this talk I hope to give a clear overview of the opportunites for applying Thompson Sampling in machine learning. I will share some technical examples in recent developments (for example Bayesian Neural Networks using Edward) but more importantly I hope to trigger the audience to start thinking strategically about how we want our machine learning models to learn from new data.\n\nSlides: /redirect?redir_token=p_i62nMAXQXexqVUrQC7jOOyPOp8MTUzMjc1ODc1NUAxNTMyNjcyMzU1&v=wcCSAbcj5Q0&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FPyData%2Fthompson-sampling-for-machine-learning-ruben-mak&event=video_description",
