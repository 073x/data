  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIn this talk I hope to give a clear overview of the opportunites for applying Thompson Sampling in machine learning. I will share some technical examples in recent developments (for example Bayesian Neural Networks using Edward) but more importantly I hope to trigger the audience to start thinking strategically about how we want our machine learning models to learn from new data.\n\nSlides: /redirect?redir_token=p_i62nMAXQXexqVUrQC7jOOyPOp8MTUzMjc1ODc1NUAxNTMyNjcyMzU1&v=wcCSAbcj5Q0&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FPyData%2Fthompson-sampling-for-machine-learning-ruben-mak&event=video_description\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
