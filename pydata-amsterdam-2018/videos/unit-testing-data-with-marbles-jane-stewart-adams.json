  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIn the same way that we need to make assertions about how code functions, we need to make assertions about data, and unit testing is a promising framework. In this talk, we'll explore what is unique about unit testing data, and see how Two Sigma's open source library Marbles addresses these unique challenges in several real-world scenarios.\n\nSlides: /redirect?event=video_description&v=enlNiRSt9nk&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FJaneAdams14%2Funit-testing-data-with-marbles-99640601&redir_token=ePzVTvxkvC6rXhGAVl7TDGPNSPN8MTUzMjc1ODc2NEAxNTMyNjcyMzY0\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
