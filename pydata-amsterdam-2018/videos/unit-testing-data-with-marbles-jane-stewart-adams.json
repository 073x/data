  "description": "In the same way that we need to make assertions about how code functions, we need to make assertions about data, and unit testing is a promising framework. In this talk, we'll explore what is unique about unit testing data, and see how Two Sigma's open source library Marbles addresses these unique challenges in several real-world scenarios.\n\nSlides: /redirect?event=video_description&v=enlNiRSt9nk&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FJaneAdams14%2Funit-testing-data-with-marbles-99640601&redir_token=ePzVTvxkvC6rXhGAVl7TDGPNSPN8MTUzMjc1ODc2NEAxNTMyNjcyMzY0",
