  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nThere is an abundance of easily mineable text data (Whatsapp, twitter, and even our own e-mails!), and we have no excuse to not analyse it. In this workshop, we will learn some tips and tricks to deal with messy text data, before moving on to some lesser looked at text analysis techniques, such as text summarisation, working with distance metrics, and an old personal favorite - topic models.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbhargavvader%2Fpersonal%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fnotebooks%2Ftext_analysis_tutorial&redir_token=3blrLCLThohVHJKAbO5MYUXdq118MTUzMjc1ODc0NEAxNTMyNjcyMzQ0&v=KFE039xtYJU&event=video_description\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
