  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nFor time series analysis, everyone's talking about ARIMA or Holt-Winters. But there's other models which could also break down a seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel data.\n\nSlides: /redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=TE74_IZ1LRBkW01yf83w4Afka6V8MTUzMjc1ODc2OEAxNTMyNjcyMzY4&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FCheukTingHo%2Fpydata-amsterdam-2018-time-series-analysis-with-seasonal-data-99093353&v=ZR9aAZZEhQo\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations.
