  "description": "Running Machine learning jobs at scale places painful demands on infrastructure from an operational perspective. As the number of jobs increase, having an easy-to-use infrastructure becomes a necessity. In this talk we will cover how we use Kubernetes at Textkernel as a job manager to scale our Tensorflow-based jobs. We will also explore other solutions such as distributed Tensorflow and Kubeflow.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fpresentation%2Fd%2F1-vP70IA_5-1xlUPhC09Pq9utxpNnTXfwCa-T_-zM8SU%2Fedit%23slide%3Did.g3b17409166_0_6&redir_token=rjd7cBg-UlVQ3YiiJorKOFxKU-d8MTUzMjc1ODc3M0AxNTMyNjcyMzcz&v=fYGu1ideQkw&event=video_description",
