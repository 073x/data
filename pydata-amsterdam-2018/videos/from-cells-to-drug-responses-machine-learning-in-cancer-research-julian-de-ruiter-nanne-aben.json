  "description": "Machine learning plays an important role in cancer research. In this talk, we\u2019ll tackle the challenge of predicting which patients are likely to respond to given anti-cancer treatments. In doing so, we\u2019ll show how tools such as Snakemake/Bioconda can be used to create reproducible workflows and illustrate the challenges of interpreting predictive models in large, highly-correlated feature spaces.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FPyData%2Ffrom-cells-to-drug-responses-machine-learning-in-cancer-research-julian-de-ruiter-nanne-aben&redir_token=gZhTcy6wIXX-9Q6PkSj4Cr8O5kZ8MTUzMjc1ODc4MUAxNTMyNjcyMzgx&v=oedAGH_LE4U&event=video_description",
