  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nMachine learning plays an important role in cancer research. In this talk, we\u2019ll tackle the challenge of predicting which patients are likely to respond to given anti-cancer treatments. In doing so, we\u2019ll show how tools such as Snakemake/Bioconda can be used to create reproducible workflows and illustrate the challenges of interpreting predictive models in large, highly-correlated feature spaces.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FPyData%2Ffrom-cells-to-drug-responses-machine-learning-in-cancer-research-julian-de-ruiter-nanne-aben&redir_token=gZhTcy6wIXX-9Q6PkSj4Cr8O5kZ8MTUzMjc1ODc4MUAxNTMyNjcyMzgx&v=oedAGH_LE4U&event=video_description\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
