  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nClassifying text is a common use case for machine learning algorithms. But despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. We will use eli5 and the LIME algorithm to explain text classifiers.\n\nSlides: /redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=Ucrn6Zc7EDnTOGnN0e4FWddRHEV8MTUzMjc1ODc3OUAxNTMyNjcyMzc5&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftsterbak%2Fpydata2018-amsterdam&v=uCQtqzl8dn4\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
