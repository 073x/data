  "description": "TensorFlow has a component named TensorFlow Object Detection, whose purpose is to train a system capable of recognizing objects in a frame. Usually, this technology is used to detect real-life objects, until I took on the challenge of building a detection system to detect everybody's favorite Pokemon, Pikachu. What is object detection, and how I built my model? That's what this talk is about.\n\nSlides: /redirect?redir_token=bM6BAMACOr-Y2JsOC8MefDtMqGd8MTUzMjc1ODc0OEAxNTMyNjcyMzQ4&event=video_description&v=Ru31N739MOM&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1imW1WMorXMNs4GO4htvT4p494w1q4bJ0%2Fview",
