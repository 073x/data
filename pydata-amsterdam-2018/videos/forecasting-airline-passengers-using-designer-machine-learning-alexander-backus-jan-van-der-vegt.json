  "description": "The ability to accurately forecast the amount of passengers that will board a particular flight is crucial for airline operations. But how do we design a machine learning algorithm for this use case and in what ways can we improve it? In this talk, we start with a simple linear model, evolving to increasingly complex deep learning neural network architectures.\n\nSlides: /redirect?v=A-azJ8qmwug&redir_token=Bm-WhsvEH5CGrs91k9KXxxkew6d8MTUzMjc1ODc0N0AxNTMyNjcyMzQ3&event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fpydata.org%2Famsterdam2018%2Fproposals%2Fdocument%2F15%2Fae34b5af-f8ae-4cac-8d85-ae08dd8690e3.pdf",
