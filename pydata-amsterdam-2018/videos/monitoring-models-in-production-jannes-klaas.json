  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nA Data Scientists work is not done once machine learning models are in production. In this talk, Jannes will explain ways of monitoring Keras neural network models in production, how to track model decay and set up alerting using Flask, Docker and a range of self-built tools.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations.
