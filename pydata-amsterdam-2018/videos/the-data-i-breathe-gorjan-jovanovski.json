  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nWe live in a age of technology, with enormous amounts of data being created and collected all around us. But, are we putting all of it to good use? Gorjan, a 25 year old software engineer, uses open data and a mobile app to lead a 3000 strong community of eco-activists in his home country of Macedonia, with the goal of saving 2.000.000 of his fellow citizens from a horrific air pollution problem.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
