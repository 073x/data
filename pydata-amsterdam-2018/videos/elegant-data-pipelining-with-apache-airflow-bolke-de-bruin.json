  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nBatch data processing, historically known as ETL, \u200ais extremely challenging. It\u2019s time-consuming, brittle, and often unrewarding. Not only that, it\u2019s hard to operate, evolve, and troubleshoot. As ETL pipelines grow in complexity, and as data teams grow in numbers, using methodologies that provide clarity isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a necessity.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
