  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nDataFrames of all sorts have become very popular for tabular data analytics for their nifty APIs and ease of use. But as they usually operate as in-memory engines, they can be hard to scale. In my talk, I'd like to outline several ways one can scale their compute platform to handle larger datasets without incurring much cost.\n\nSlides: /redirect?event=video_description&v=ggS2oK-ewFk&redir_token=mHTrdTyxrQWKzAEAZoCw5xMtP918MTUzMjc1ODc3NkAxNTMyNjcyMzc2&q=https%3A%2F%2Fpydata.org%2Famsterdam2018%2Fproposals%2Fdocument%2F13%2F7df60e05-18b0-4f44-a97a-3f76f5d9ff20.pdf\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
