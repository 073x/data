  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIs it possible to apply data science to a creative task? In my talk, I will cover my research to the (semi-)automated creation of advertisement product compositions. The resulting application co-creates compositions with graphic designers by making use of an evolutionary algorithm with user input. The algorithm is built in DEAP and runs on AWS.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
