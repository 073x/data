  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nIoT adoption is raising, together with the number of other types of scenarios, where high-performance streaming analytics becomes a critical component. In this tutorial we focus on the capabilities of structured streaming in Apache Spark, for building so-called continuous applications in the cloud. Microsoft Azure is used as the running platform.\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
