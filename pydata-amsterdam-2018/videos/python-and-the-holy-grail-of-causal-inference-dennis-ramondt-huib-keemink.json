  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nCausal Inference, AKA how effective is your new product, policy or feature? Inspired by A\\B testing in tech, organizations have turned to randomized testing. However, randomization often fails, leaving us in a biased reality. Join us on our quest to dispel myths about randomized testing and build practical models for effect measurement in business situations, in this Eneco-Heineken joint talk.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FPyData%2Fpython-and-the-holy-grail-of-causal-inference-dennis-ramondt-huib-keemink&v=HPC42U9xtQY&event=video_description&redir_token=MUODf75Tlqs5Psd5okQ0h4X2Xl98MTUzMjc1ODc3NEAxNTMyNjcyMzc0\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
