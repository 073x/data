  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nThere are several tools to build ML dashboards and visulisations. Their focus is often on making it as simple as possible for a (Python) data scientist. Shipp ing them as part of our product means that other roles like frontend developers get involved. Aspects that ease development for one role, create pains for oth ers. We want to show how balance this using Altair, Vega and Vue.\n\nSlides: /redirect?redir_token=fLWWkgXxwt3JxcpAss9nzWT55498MTUzMjc1ODc3N0AxNTMyNjcyMzc3&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fxhochy%2Fpydata-amsterdam-2018-building-customervisible-data-science-dashboards-with-altair-vega-vue&event=video_description&v=4L568emKOvs\n--\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
