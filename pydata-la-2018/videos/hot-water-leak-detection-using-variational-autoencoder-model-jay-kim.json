  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nAt the Southern California Gas Company, we need to distinguish between various types of abnormal gas usage. SoCalGas has built predictive models to detect such instances. For example, we need to identify water leaks from gas leaks and respond appropriately. The Hot Water Leak Detection was performed by Using Variational Autoencoder Model.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
