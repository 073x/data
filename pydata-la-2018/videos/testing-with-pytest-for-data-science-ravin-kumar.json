  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nUnit Testing isn't just for traditional applications. Testing is useful in data applications as well, from testing assumptions about the underlying structure of information, to testing your knowledge of math libraries.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll showing you how to use pytest from scratch. By the end you'll know enough to be able to use it in your next project.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations.
