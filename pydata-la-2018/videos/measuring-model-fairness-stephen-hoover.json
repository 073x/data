  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nMachine learning models are increasingly used to make decisions that affect people\u2019s lives. With this power comes a responsibility to ensure that model predictions are fair. In this talk I\u2019ll introduce several common model fairness metrics, discuss their tradeoffs, and finally demonstrate their use with a case study analyzing anonymized data from one of Civis Analytics\u2019s client engagements.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/measuring-model-fairness-stephen-hoover\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
