  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nWe introduce JupyterLab, the next-generation UI developed by the Project Jupyter team, and its emerging ecosystem of extensions. JupyterLab is the next-generation Jupyter Notebook, providing a set of core building blocks for interactive computing (e.g. notebook, terminal, file browser, console) and well-designed interfaces for them that allow users to combine them in novel ways.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
