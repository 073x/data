  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nWorking in the cloud means you don\u2019t have to deal with hardware. The goal of \"serverless\" is to also avoid dealing with operating systems. It offers instances that run for the duration of a single function call. These instances have limitations, but a lot of what data scientists do is a perfect fit for this new world! We'll see how to train and deploy machine learning using this infrastructure.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
