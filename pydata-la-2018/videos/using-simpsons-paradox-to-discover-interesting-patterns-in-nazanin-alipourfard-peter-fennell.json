  "description": "PyData LA 2018\n\nThis package takes a step toward solving the problem of large size and heterogeneity of behavioral data, by automating discovery from data by leveraging Simpson\u2019s Paradox. The paradox is a phenomenon wherein the entirety of a population behaves differently or in some cases even opposite to the trend observed in the underlying subgroups.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
