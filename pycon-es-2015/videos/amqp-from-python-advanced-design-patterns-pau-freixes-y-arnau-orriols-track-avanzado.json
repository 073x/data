  "description": "AMQP as standard application layer protocol is widely used to design backends where business logic is spread around different processes using a broker to link them, usually RabbitMQ. AMQP allows us to use different design patterns than the traditional monolithic backends, where part of your business logic is designed as entities of the AMQP topology. In this talk we will talk about the Python drivers such as Celery, Pika and others, and how they can be used to get the full power of the AMQP.",
