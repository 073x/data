  "description": "Rachel Bunder\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/154/view_talk\nPython is an easy language to learn. Many Python programmers just picked it up thinking \u201cIt can\u2019t be too different from X, just with indents!\u201d. By learning a language this way you don\u2019t discover the features unique to that language.\n\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll take a tour of Python features that are easily missed. This includes list comprehension,  generator functions and the PEP documents. Where appropriate time comparisons between different methods will be given.",
