If so, there are a bunch of tips and tricks that you can learn that will get you up to speed very quickly.\n\nCreating lesson content is always demanding and time-consuming.  Using screencasts as a medium of instruction is no different, but there are clearly very specific habits that can make you much more efficient.  Specific advice about working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook will also be covered.\n\nSecondly, this talk will also touch on aspects related to working with a publisher.
