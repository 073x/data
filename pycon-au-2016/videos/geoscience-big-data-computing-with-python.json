In particular, a datacube system has been developed recently using Python as a core technology. The system manages petabyte-scale earth-observation satellite imagery datasets. And has enabled a wide range of applications such as the Water Observation from Space.\n\nThis talk is about how Geoscience Australia applies scientific computing (Python) to the big data challenges.",
