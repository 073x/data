By making use of standard library modules such as the fractions module, third party packages such as matplotlib and sympy, the audience will learn how to write programs to solve common math problems. Some of the topics that will be discussed are:\n\n- Simulating uniform and non-uniform random events\n- Drawing Fractals\n- Solving algebraic equations and inequalities\n- Solving calculus problems",
