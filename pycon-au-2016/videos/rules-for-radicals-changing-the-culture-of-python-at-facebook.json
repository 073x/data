But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 and existing codebases have plans to move to Python 3.5.  All without official support or sanction.\n\n\"Rules for Radicals\" is a book for community organizers by the late Saul Alinsky on how to unite people to effect positive change in their communities.",
