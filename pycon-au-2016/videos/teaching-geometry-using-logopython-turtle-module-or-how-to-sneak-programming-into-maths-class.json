  "description": "Vivian Li\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/117/view_talk\nWith the new national curriculum for Digital Technologies, there is a fantastic opportunity (and in some schools, need) to teach programming in conjunction with other learning areas. Python is an ideal first language, and there is a natural and deep relationship between mathematics and computer science.\n\nWe used the Python\u2019s Turtle module (an implementation of Logo) to create resources that integrate the Year 7 Geometry topic and the basics of Python programming in a way that\u2019s highly engaging for students. Learn about how we integrated the two subject areas and the results of our pilot run with a cohort of Year 7 students in NSW.",
