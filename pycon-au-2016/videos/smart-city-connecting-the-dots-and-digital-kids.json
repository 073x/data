  "description": "Roland Gesthuizen\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/203/view_talk\nSchools face a daunting challenge to increase their student\nexposure to coding, hands-on technology learning to solve some\nreal-world problems and teaching STEM principles (Science, Technology,\nEngineering and Mathematics) through design, construction and testing.\nThis personal presentation by a leading teacher illustrate journey to\nconnect his students to some real-world problems and the challenges\nfaced along the way. Following on from an earlier\ncomputational-thinking challenge to build and program a moving\nvehicle, Roland's current mission is to challenge students to design,\nbuild a smart city consisting of intelligent vehicles and\ninfrastructure. To do this they need to program a navigation algorithm\nto autonomously navigate vehicles through a series of traffic\nchallenges that test collision avoidance and road safety. They have\nbeen invited to showcase their work at the ITS2016 Word Congress in\nMelbourne with a maker-space for delegates to share our hands-on\nproblem solving and learning with the software and models developed by\nthe students. Moonshots live in a grey area between audacious\ntechnology and pure science fiction. Our moonshot was to empower\nstudents around the globe to build and control their future.",
