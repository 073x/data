It's a little more complicated. These techniques, used by hackers to gather information on their target, are hard to combat without education - so why don\u2019t we talk about them more often? Aimed at the average user who could be targeted by such an attack, this talk discusses the tools of social engineering, how it can be combated and why so many companies fail in preparing their employees for such an attack.",
