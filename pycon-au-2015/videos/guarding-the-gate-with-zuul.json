  "description": "Zuul is a program that is used to gate the source code repositories of a\nproject so that changes are only merged if they pass tests.\n\nBy gating we mean a more proactive continuous integration suite whereby\ntests must pass in order to merge (rather than a traditional CI that\njust gives a nightly status of the master branch). This means every\ncommit is tested both during review time and before it merges - in case\nthe repositories have changed in the mean time.\n\nThe result of using a gating system like zuul is that it's much harder\nto break trunk and your nightly builds should nearly always work.\n\nZuul can be configured to react to events and run various jobs with\nsuccess or failure results depending on the scenario. Currently Zuul is\nonly integrated with the gerrit code review platform but there are\ndiscussions about extending it to github.\n\nOne unique and powerful feature in Zuul is its ability to run tests in a\npredictive manner across multiple programs. Zuul predicts what multiple\nrepositories will look like by the time the present job is finished and\narranges the tests to be performed in that order. This stops race\nconditions when merging code in one repository that depends on code in\nanother repository.\n\nZuul can manage thousands of jobs across hundreds of projects as evident\nby being the gate keeper for OpenStack.\n\nIn this talk we will look at what Zuul is, how to configure it and the\ninternals of how it works.\n",
