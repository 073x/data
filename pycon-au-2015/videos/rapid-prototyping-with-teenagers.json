  "description": "This is teamwork and rapid prototyping challenges on steroids. Imagine\n15 high school kids, most of whom have only just learned to program,\nworking together to design and build a fully functional social\nnetworking site in 3 days.\n\nThis project is done as part of the NCSS (National Computer Science\nSchool) summer program. NCSS has been running for 20 years, and I've\nbeen involved in the last 7, so that's 6 different social networking\nsites (we used to build search engines, but apparently they're not cool\nanymore).\n\nI'll go through the technical details, the tools we use, how the site\nfunctions, and how we structure the different pieces to come together.\nI'll also show off some extra fun projects we throw at the advanced\nkids, like building their own Django-like template engine, and secure\nhashing of passwords.\n\nA lot of the challenge of this undertaking is inevitably also project\nmanagement and coordination of the team. These students have never\nwritten tests before, don't know what version control is and don't\nunderstand what it means to agree on an API. Hilarity and frustration\ncan (and does) ensue, especially during the last night, which is an\nall-nighter.\n\nCome along to learn how to do project management with the least\nexperienced team possible and how to hack together a functional\nprototype webapp with minimum effort.\n",
