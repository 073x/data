  "description": "Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship,\nand run distributed applications. This allows for rapidly deployable\napps, which will run on any docker environment with the ability to\nrapidly scale.\n\nAs Docker is based on Linux containers, these are very lightweight and\nallow resource isolation. With added tools to provide workflow\nautomation and image management, Docker can provide a complete toolset\nto manage your application environment.\n\nAimed at newcomers to the technology, this talk will cover the basics of\nwhat Docker is, how it compares to other technologies and with why it's\nuseful for Python applications. There will be practical demos and\nexamples of real world Python deployments included.\n",
