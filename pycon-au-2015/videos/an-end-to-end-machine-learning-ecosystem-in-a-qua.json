  "description": "Building a machine learning model is hard. Building and serving\nindividual machine learning models for thousands of customers every\nsingle day is harder. Model training time must be kept to a minimum,\nmemory constraints are exacerbated and the love and insight that one\nwould usually apply to refining a single model must be automated and\nscaled. At Zendesk we successfully use pandas, scikit-learn, flask and\nhadoop to run a machine learning ecosystem that builds, tunes and serves\naccount specific models via an API for many of our customers. This talk\nis about what we learnt building it and how Python's data stack let us\nget it to production really really fast.\n",
