  "description": "The unfortunate truth about networked applications is that an attacker\nonly needs to know one thing you didn't know to get past your defenses.\nYou need to know everything, they don't.\n\nThe odds aren't in your favour. You're eventually going to get hacked.\n\nThat's the bad news. But if you stop thinking about a security\ncompromise as that thing you close your eyes and hope never happens\",\nand instead start thinking about it as an inevitability, then you can\nstart making better security decisions.\n\n\"If they compromise my web servers, how do I protect my application\nservers?\"\n\n\"If they break my application server code, how can I prevent them from\ngaining a foothold on my infrastructure?\"\n\n\"If they poison my web-site with cross-site scripting, how do I find out\nbefore my users get hurt?\"\n\nIn short: \"If I\u2019m going to get hacked, how do I make it hurt less?\"\n\nThis is a talk about defense in depth.\n\nBuilding a secure system isn\u2019t about luck, it\u2019s about planning.\n",
