  "description": "Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python, that has\ntaken the world of IT automation by storm. Its most remarkable quality\nis simplicity.\n\nThe Zen of Python is a set of aphorisms which capture the design\nphilosophy of the Python language, one being \"Simple is better than\ncomplex\".\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll look at some of the concrete ways that Ansible\nembodies the Zen of Python, in an attempt to unravel the true meaning of\nthe sometimes cryptic aphorisms. Along the way we will consider why\nsimplicity is a such good thing, yet tantalisingly out of reach in most\nsoftware projects.\n",
