  "description": "Design Patterns, standard designs and idioms in Python\n\nPythonic (Noun): Uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows\nfluency in the language.\n\nEven though you\u2019re using Python syntax and keywords, your code still\nsmells like C, Java or Perl. Or just feels like it's not the best way.\nThis tour of Python is about changing the way you think, and to write\nPython that makes the best use of the language. As a result, your Python\nwill be cleaner, simpler, nicer, and be more readable.\n\nEven though you know the syntax to make a class and inherit, you don't\nknow when you should. Composition? IsA, HasA, IsLikeA? What about\nfactories, singletons, iterators and adapters?\n\nMashing together a long and painful background of C, C++, Perl and Java\ncoding, a mind-expanding trip down the Elements of Reusable\nObject-Oriented Software rabbit hole, and over 30 years programming\nexperience, Peter brings some clarity, reason and ideas on Pythonic\nidioms and OO design as implemented in Python.\n",
