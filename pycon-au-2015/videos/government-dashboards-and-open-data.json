  "description": "More and more governments around Australia and the world are starting to\ntalk the talk on Open Data as an essential component of open government.\nBut to what extent do they walk the walk? CKAN based data repositories\nlike data.gov.au (at the Australian federal level) provide powerful APIs\nfor searching and discovering published data-sets, but at the end of all\nthat search and discovery, the data-sets themselves sometimes make it\nclear that somebody somewhere has missed the point.\n\nIn developing dashboard applications for state and federal government\nagencies over the past 6 months, I have seen the good, the bad and the\nugly not only in terms of API design and data set presentation, but also\nin terms of commitment to Open Data.\n",
