  "description": "MidoNet is a Software Defined Networking solution that's currently\nintegrated with OpenStack, Eucalyptus and Docker. We open sourced in\nNovember last year and we\u2019re working hard to build a strong community\naround it.\n\nThis presentation will cover MidoNet's core concepts, what distinguishes\nit from other SDN solutions, its core design and why you would choose it\nfor your project/business. Or not. I'll also discuss some of the cool\nfeatures that we're currently working on, especially around Multi-site\nFederation.\n\nYou\u2019ll be introduced to concepts like Topology Aware Switches and JIT\nDatapath flow computation as well as our distributed agent model. You\u2019ll\nlearn why we strongly believe in having intelligent switches and how\nthis impacts the overlay topology definition as well as the Network\nFunction Virtualization implementation.\n\nMost importantly, we hope you'll head over to midonet.org and take it\nfor a spin.\n",
