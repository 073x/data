  "description": "\"Ugh, why does Unicode have to be so complicated? It's just text, why\ncan't it be as simple as writing a note for myself?\"\n\nOne of the more controversial changes in Python 3 is the decision to\nhandle text data entirely as Unicode code points. In this presentation,\nCPython core developer Nick Coghlan will explore some of the background\nof that design decision, the capabilities it grants Python 3 over Python\n2, and some of the related features of the upcoming Python 3.5 release.\n",
