  "description": "In practically every moment of our life we rely on the possibly largest\ncommunication medium humanity ever had. The Internet. Being able to at\nleast partially understand how this *thing* works, we know that it takes\na lot of work to keep it running smoothly.\n\nTo do that IT administrators use configuration and system management\ntools to deploy changes to thousands of servers and keep them in sync.\nBut how can one roll back a change done in the past that turned out to\nintroduce a bug?\n\nThis talk I will introduce you to configuration management and explain\nthe problems that arise over time and make changing something back\ncomplicated or even impossible.\n",
