  "description": "Flask is a Python web framework that is both lightweight and powerful.\nWith an active community, and a diverse and versatile choice of plugins,\nFlask allows you to scale from simple single-URL websites through to\nhighly complex website architectures.\n\nIn this talk we will begin by setting up a simple Flask powered website\nand get it running on the Heroku PaaS. We will then demonstrate how to\nintegrate Flask and SQLAlchemy (a powerful ORM) to allow database access\nand get this uploaded and working on Heroku as well.\n\nFinally we will discuss some more advanced concepts and review a number\nof the Flask plugins to get you started on the path to building great\nweb-based projects.\n",
