  "description": "This talk will relate the experience of teaching coding, including\nPython, to a (nominally) 6-18 age group at a local Brisbane CoderDojo\nfor 2015 Term 1 and 2.\n\nScratch and Alice have become very popular for teaching beginner coding\nat CoderDojo events. Languages such as Python, and even HTML/CSS, are\nmore difficult to introduce, partly because more skills are required\nbefore something \"useful\" can be created, and partly because the\n\"building blocks\" are usually not presented with the same visual\nimmediacy as Scratch, and similar environments. This talk presents some\nof the difficulties found in transitioning from graphical environments\nto Python, and observations in using existing tools for learning Python\nwith younger students.\n",
