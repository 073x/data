  "description": "Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is a valuable research tool in fluid dynamics, but there are very few publicly available codes and, due to heavy number crunching, codes are usually written in low-level languages. In this talk I will describe a pure Python DNS code that nearly matches the performance of pure C for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns.",
