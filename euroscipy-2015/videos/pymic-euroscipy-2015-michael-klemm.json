  "description": "The Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor strives to provide additional compute power to HPC applications. This talk introduces the pyMIC module for offloading to the coprocessor from scientific Python codes. Its easy-to-use interface to invoke compute kernels, while handling data transfers in a flexible yet performant way. We will describe pyMIC's design and show how to use pyMIC in Python HPC applications.",
