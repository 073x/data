  "description": "Designing a space mission is a computation-heavy task. Software tools that conduct the necessary numerical simulations and optimizations are therefore indispensable. Since the beginning of computational astrodynamics the language of choice has been Fortran and more recently MATLAB. This talk explores how Python's unique strengths and its ecosystem make it a viable alternative for future missions.",
