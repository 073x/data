  "description": "Kwant (http://kwant-project.org/), a package for quantum transport, is a recent addition to the scientific Python universe. I will demonstrate how our library allows to solve non-trivial problems with a few lines of code and explain why it is faster, more general, and easier to use than alternatives written in pure C/C++ or Fortran and how your own non-quantum programs can profit from it.",
