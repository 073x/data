  "description": "The Full Stack of User Experience by Alicia C  Raciti\n\nUser experience(UX) has come to the forefront of the design world over the last 5-10 years. As the internet and its content have evolved, we\u2019re asking now more than ever about user goals when they visit the websites and software we create.\n\nUX terms like Information Architecture, Interaction Design, and Research are regularly thrown around, but what are they and how does it impact a site and product?\n\nThis talk will define UX and it\u2019s sub-disciplines to bring understanding to what UX is. Practical deliverables will be shared in an effort to give attendees something that they can begin to implement into their process.",
