  "description": "Building JSON APIS With Django / Pinax by Brian Rosner\n\nJavascript is a language we simply cannot ignore. It isn't just Javascript too. Objective-C, Swift and Java are all languages we are finding we need to work with to meet client expectations about a web app.\n\nThe role Django (and Python) plays in this new world is becoming a bit more limited. There are plenty of great efforts to get Python running everywhere, but this talk isn't about any of that. This talk is about building the API all of these frontends need to communicate with to drive persistent and business logic.\n\npinax-api was originally built to serve the needs of a particular client at Eldarion, but later pulled out as its own app. It provides a simple and modern interface to building an API with Django. At its core, pinax-api leverages the JSON:API spec that was built out of Ember.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\nwhat is JSON:API\nJSON:API in pinax-api\nAPI primitives provided by pinax-pai\nhow pinax-api leverages Django to its fullest\nautomatic documentation generation using API Blueprint\nwhy not Django REST Framework?",
