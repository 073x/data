  "description": "Just Enough Typography by Joni Trythall\n\nDesign is 95% typography \u2026 or something like that. Having a grasp on what makes for pleasant, easy to read typography that reinforces your brand is the first step towards building an amazing, impactful experience. Together we will explore typography fundamentals:\n\nSizing, spacing, and rhythm to make all of our type feel cohesive.\nHow to improve readability and encourage the user to read.\nType families and different styles.\nChoosing and pairing fonts, how many to use, and when to use them.\nMuch more!\nThese typography basics will help you better understand why some typefaces just don\u2019t work and give you some go-to solutions for when the designer is out sick (or has gone crazy). We\u2019ll learn a bunch but not too much, it will be just enough :grin:",
