  "description": "DjangoCon US 2016 - SSL All The Things by Markus Holtermann\n\nOver the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other services as well has risen tremendously. The Let\u2019s Encrypt organization and certificate authority (CA) makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 almost 1.8 million certificates have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!\n\nIn this talk I'll demonstrate how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out some common pitfalls. I\u2019ll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and explain what you need to set up in Django to make SSL/TLS the default and only way to access your site.",
