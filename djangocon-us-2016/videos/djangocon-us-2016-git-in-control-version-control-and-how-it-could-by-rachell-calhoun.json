  "description": "Git in Control, Version Control and How it Could save Your Life by Rachell Calhoun\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t break GitHub, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Maybe you can\u2019t break it but you can sure get yourself into a labyrinth of git commands. Version control can be a headache but it can also save your project.\n\nThere are certain pitfalls to avoid when using Git, I\u2019ve probably found most of them and stumbled my way out. While my goal is to help you avoid them altogether, I also want to give you the skills to work through these pitfalls so you can make it out alive and with your project intact.\n\nWhether you\u2019re working on your own project, or collaborating with others you can learn how to git survive anything. We\u2019ll discuss the benefits version control has for your own projects as well as projects with others.\n\nFor all of you awesome collaborators working with others on a project, we\u2019ll go over important steps to take while handling others\u2019 code and \u2018gitiquette\u2019 so you can save yourself the embarrassment of faux pas in the git world.\n\nMy goal is to give you an overview of Github flow, provide solutions for potential problems you may encounter, and help you feel more comfortable with version control.",
