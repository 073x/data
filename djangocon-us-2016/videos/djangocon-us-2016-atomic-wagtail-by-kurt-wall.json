  "description": "Atomic Wagtail by Kurt Wall\n\nWHAT IS WAGTAIL\n\nWagtail is a Django-based CMS made by developers that were just sick of the current solutions out there for reasons from usability to extensibility. It provides a sleek and intuitive editing experience, while keeping its design open and flexible for creating custom frameworks. I'll first explain what Wagtail is, how we can use it, what features make it great, and what makes it not so great.\n\nATOMIC DESIGN\n\nBrad Frost coined this term in reference to his taxonomical design model. The model breaks down design layouts from the simplest element to the more complex layouts. I'll briefly go over what this model is.\n\nATOMIC WAGTAIL\n\nAtomic design lends well to the strengths and some features of Wagtail. I'll tell you how you can use Atomic design in harmony with Wagtail, with tips and pitfalls you might encounter along the way.\n\nLESSONS LEARNED\n\nAny new approach to something is going to be both fun and frustrating. I'll list some of the most frustrating aspects of Wagtail, trickled with some advice.",
