  "description": "From Developer to Manager by Sean O'Connor\n\nAs developers move along in their career, they are often encouraged to take on roles that involve more and more people management and less code.\n\nStepping towards management often can be a good move to make, but it is not one that should be taken lightly. If such a move is taken without a full appreciation for what it truly is (a career change), it can lead to woe and misery for all involved.\n\nIn this talk we'll follow one developer's journey from coding 40 hours/week to primarily managing humans. What worked well, what didn't work well, what was hard, and what was surprising.\n\nAttendees of this talk should expect to walk away with a better idea of if they may be suited for management and if so, how they can successfully acclimate to their new role.",
