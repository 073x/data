You should change the style of your app to display them in a correct format. Some graphic elements should be flipped horizontally to make sense for them.\n\nCHARACTER ENCODING ISSUES\n\nWhen you are working with a language with completely different form of alphabet and characters there is a huge chance that you face an issue if you don\u2019t abide some encoding standards.\n\nCALENDAR SYSTEM\n\nSome of those countries have their own calendar which is completely different from gregorian calendar which is used in most of west countries. There are some apps helping you to convert unix timestamp to those different calendar format in both backend and frontend side\n\nINTERFACE DESIGN AND PROPER FONTS\n\nAs their language is RTL some graphic elements need to be mirrored. Although it is true for most of layout parts but there are still some sections that needs to keep their direction, like mathematical equations, multimedia players progress bar, \u2026 Using modern frontend tools like SASS mixin to automatically float elements depending on the language direction.",
