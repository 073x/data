  "description": "People are Coming to My Beginning Workshop, What Now?  by Nicholle James\n\nVolunteers often love running introductory programming workshops. This talk covers how to help attendees get the most out of your volunteer time. We\u2019ll look at how to make a tutorial easier for attendees to follow and tips that help students stay relaxed and learn effectively. The talk incorporates what I learned as a student teacher and includes a new source of help in revising newcomer material.",
